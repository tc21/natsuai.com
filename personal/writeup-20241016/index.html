Part 1.4 - LED dot matrix display
Part number: TOM2057FEG-1B
- that's it. it's a 2-color LED dot matrix display (the two colors are green and red). i have no idea how it works

Part 2 - experiment results; analysis

Part 2.1 - experiment results

By setting X = 1, Y = 1, A = 1, B = 1, C = 1 and then cycling the clock, we were able to set all LEDs of the top row (we will call it row 7) to orange (green + red).

At clock cycle 1, the upper-left (row 7, column 1) is turned on. At clock cycle 2, row 7 column 2 turns on as well. Some clock cycles nothing changes, but most clock cycles turn one more light on. Eventually, all 80 lights in row 7 become orange.

However, setting row 7 LEDs to orange is the only action that is reproducible. By setting X = 0, Y = 1, we were able to (very briefly, by chance,) set some LEDs (around the middle of the top row) red. No LEDs of rows 1...6 were ever set to any color.

When A, B, or C is not 1, though, we can notice faint flickering in all lights of the other rows. We suspect the binary number ABC (or is it CBA? I don't quite remember) selects which row to turn lights on or off. (Though we were only able to operate on row 7, and only turning lights on. Never off.)

Part 2.1 - analysis

There are 24 LS164, each feeding into a ULN2002A, for a total of 164 connections into the 80x7 dot matrix display.

We notice the 24 LS164 are split into 2 sets of 12: controller output X feeds inputs A & B of LS164 #1, LS164 #1 output Qg feeds inputs A & B of LS164 #3, and so forth for #5, #7, ... Controller output Y feeds inputs A & B of LS164 #2, etc.

Therefore we conclude X and Y control the green and red LEDs respectively, and each group has 82 outputs. We suspect that 80 of those outputs control what to show in each column. By setting X = 1, Y = 1 and cycling the clock, we are turning on column #N and clock cycle #N, and never turning it off. That is why we see the behavior of lights turning on one by one. It is orange because orange is red plus green.

It is unclear why we can only control row 7. It is also unclear why we don't see lights turning on with X = 0, Y = 1 or X = 1, Y = 0.
