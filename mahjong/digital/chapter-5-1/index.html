             In general, what kind of number tiles are discarded at the very start of a hand? Discarding in the early stages of a game is often mechanical, owing to the lack of information on the table. Everyone plays differently, but typically people start by discarding single tiles unrelated to other tiles, and they start those by discarding tiles that don't contribute to any yaku.

             Let's imagine the first couple of number-tile discards from the three hands given above. Let's ignore discarding honor tiles for now. All three hands occur in the east round.
        </p>
        <p>
             Hand <strong>A</strong>: We'll discard <span class="tiles">z</span> while keeping the still-faraway souzu ittsu in mind, and likely discard <span class="tiles">il</span> as the hand progresses.
        </p>
        <p>
             Hand <strong>B</strong>: <span class="tiles">qza</span> are all difficult to use in this hand, but we'll keep in mind the possibility of making our pinzu shape better and start by discarding <span class="tiles">qa</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
             Hand <strong>C</strong>: We can see the possibility of chanta and honitsu. Let's start with discarding <span class="tiles">wd</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
             Now, do you see what the first discards of all three hands have in common? It's the fact that we don't have any tiles next to our first couple of discards. That is, people discarding 1 early generally don't have 1 or 2, and those discarding 2 generally don't have 1, 2, or 3. Then looking at the suit, we see that people generally don't have many tiles in the same suit as their first discards.
        </p>
        <p>
             This is not a phenomenon constrained to these example hands. It's simply unavoidable in any mahjong ruleset that accepts ittsu and honitsu as yaku. For those who think this isn't true, please take a look at your own discards and compare for yourself. You'll discover that it's rare when you have tiles next to your first number tile discard. Not often will you have most of your hand be the same suit as your first discard. If you have to opportunity to look at paifu or watch mahjong online, you may be surprised at what you find out.
        </p>
        <p>
             Make sure to be conscious of this relationship between a hand's first discards and its final shape.
