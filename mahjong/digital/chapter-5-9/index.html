             What should be discarded from hand <strong>A</strong>? This is a hand from the South wind player, East 1, turn 5. With a dora tripled but no yaku, we should try to declare riichi as quickly as possible. Some of you might think making a ryanmen set is the most efficient, such as discarding <span class="tiles">v</span> to make hand <strong>B</strong>. The tenpai draws are <span class="tiles">wti</span> and <span class="tiles">xb</span>. Since drawing <span class="tiles">gk</span> doesn't get you into tenpai, it turns out there wasn't really a reason to keep <span class="tiles">h</span>. Therefore, we should think about possibly getting into tenpai by drawing <span class="tiles">v</span> or <span class="tiles">j</span> into a triplet. (See also <a href="https://natsuai.com/mahjong/digital/chapter-1-7/"> 1.6 Perfect 1-Shanten</a>.) The possible discards here are <span class="tiles">c</span> and <span class="tiles">h</span>. Look at the table, and compare <span class="tiles">xb</span> and <span class="tiles">gk</span>, and discard from the suit that clearly has less tiles available.
        </p>
        <p>
             But what about when you can't tell which suit is better, such as in the first few turns? Can we make a decision one way or another? Let's change our perspectives and think a little bit about the future. If you discard <span class="tiles">c</span>, and draw <span class="tiles">wti</span> or <span class="tiles">gk</span>, you will discard <span class="tiles">j</span> and declare riichi. Your discard pile will be something like <strong>C</strong>. If you discard <span class="tiles">h</span>, the same draws will give you a discard pile like <strong>D</strong>.

        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact discards">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">4ao5c1<span class="sideways">J</span></span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>

            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact discards">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">4ao5h1<span class="sideways">V</span></span></div>
                    </div>

             Think about the differences between these two discard piles from the perspective of your opponents. With <strong>C</strong>, expect for genbutsu, no tiles are really safe. Since <span class="tiles">j</span> is the riichi declaration tile, <span class="tiles">gk</span> and <span class="tiles">hl</span> are quite dangerous, but you can't be sure since so many tiles are still dangerous. Whether your wait is <span class="tiles">gk</span> or <span class="tiles">wti</span>, if you force your genbutsu-less opponents to fight against you, you should be confident in winning.
        </p>
        <p>
             What about <strong>D</strong>? Obviously <span class="tiles">xb</span> and <span class="tiles">cn</span> are dangerous, but still you can't really tell. That said, with <span class="tiles">v</span> and <span class="tiles">h</span> being genbutsu, the <span class="tiles">zvm</span> and <span class="tiles">dhl</span> suji become fairly safe. With 4 additional tiles to discard, it becomes much easier for your opponents to defend. With such a good hand, don't make your hand easier to defend against.
        </p>
        <p>
             To summarize, with hand <strong>A</strong>, you should discard <span class="tiles">c</span>, to maximize your speed to tenpai, and minimize the information you give away in your discard pile. From the perspective of your opponents, try to make your discard pile as difficult to work with as possible.
