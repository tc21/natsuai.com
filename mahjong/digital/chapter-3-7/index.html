             There are many tiles you can call with the hand above. Let's look at these six: <span class="tiles">cafjk1</span>. Try ranking these six tiles by how much you want to call them, and then think about which tiles you would call, and which tiles you wouldn't call.
        </p>
        <p> Have you come up with your answers? I'd like to share my own opinions.</p>
        <p>
             First of all, the tile you want to call the most is the double-wind <span class="tiles">1</span>. You should all agree with this. The next best tile to call, in my opinion, is <span class="tiles">c</span>, though I think lots of people would also choose <span class="tiles">a</span>. Compared to <span class="tiles">c</span>, you definitely have a yaku, making it easier to call the rest of your hand. But if your first call is <span class="tiles">a</span>, is <span class="tiles">c</span> a tile that's likely to come out? Suddenly calling a ryanmen shape like that makes people question whether you have a confirmed yaku at all. Even if you later call <span class="tiles">1</span> or <span class="tiles">j</span>, people will still be wary of sanshoku, making the 2 and 3 of manzu and pinzu difficult to come out -- especially against experienced players.
        </p>
        <p>
             On the other hand, calling <span class="tiles">c</span> might just be to take care of the weak penchan <span class="tiles">c</span> shape, and is less likely to be read as sanshoku compared to calling <span class="tiles">a</span>. Thus 1-3 tiles won't become extremely difficult to come out, and calling a not-really-useful tile like <span class="tiles">a</span> is still very probable. Additionally, this hand has more than one out. As long as you don't keep on drawing undesirable tiles, you will have a yaku. In other words, you have a &ldquo;3/4 chance of winning&rdquo;. Even if you draw <span class="tiles">f</span>, killing both chanta and sanshoku, you can just win with <span class="tiles">1</span>. Also after calling <span class="tiles">c</span> you should take <span class="tiles">j</span> or <span class="tiles">k</span> for tenpai. To summarize, our order of tiles so far is <span class="tiles">1ca</span>. These are the tiles you want to call.
        </p>
        <p>
             As for the other tiles, like <span class="tiles">f</span> which gets rid of chanta and sanshoku, leaving you only with <span class="tiles">1</span>, or <span class="tiles">j</span> and <span class="tiles">k</span> which requires you to finish the sanshoku, are better left uncalled. In conclusion, the tiles in order from best to worst are <span class="tiles">1cajkf</span>, and we want to call tiles that are better than <span class="tiles">a</span>. To get better at mahjong, calling because &ldquo;it advances my hand&rdquo; is not enough. You need to not just secure a yaku, but also think about how likely tiles are to come out later on, the size of your hand, as well as what turn it is.
