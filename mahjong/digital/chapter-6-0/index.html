        <p> Here's the promised commentary on chapter 6 I mentioned in the foreword for chapter 5.</p>
        <p>
             Compared to reading other players, camouflaging is an even more advanced trick. If other players aren't trying to read your hands, then there's no use camouflaging them. Camouflaging is based on the fact that you should be either keeping the most efficient tiles in your hand, or the safest tiles in your hand (and, in fact, everyone does so most of the time). If you don't do that, opponents may read your hands in ways that benefit you instead. In other words, camouflaging is the trading of present-time tile efficiency for a higher ron rate when you are tenpai.
        </p>
        <p>
             So conversely, if your opponents aren't actively trying to read your hands, then by camouflaging, you would be trading tile efficiency for nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
             Therefore, I recommend that you do not camouflage your hands, because if you're at a high-enough level where you need to learn and practice how to camouflage your hands, then you should be able to confidently ignore my recommendation.
        </p>
        <p>
             Of course, I think it's good to learn about camouflaging regardless, since it's more of an intermediate-level, rather than an advanced-level technique.
        </p>
