             After honor tiles, let's talk about terminal tiles. Much like honor tiles, tiles that look similar at first glance may have miniscule differences, which can add up to a real difference in your results.

        </div>
        <p>
             <strong>A</strong> is the dealer's starting hand. As dealer, you wouldn't discard the double <span class="tiles">1</span>, so you're choosing between <span class="tiles">q</span> and tiles(1p). There correct discard here is <span class="tiles">z</span>. Discarding <span class="tiles">q</span> causes you to miss out on <span class="tiles">qwe</span> draws. On the other hand, because you have <span class="tiles">v</span>, discarding <span class="tiles">z</span> still allows you to make use of <span class="tiles">x</span> and <span class="tiles">c</span>, limiting your tile efficiency loss to a minimum.
        </p>
        <p>
             <strong>B</strong> is just like <strong>A</strong>: there correct discard is <span class="tiles">z</span>. There is not much reason to keep the <span class="tiles">z</span> here. Even if you make <span class="tiles">zxvv</span>, it's difficult to make two sets out of that shape.
        </p>
        <p>
             What about <strong>C</strong>? The difference between <strong>C</strong> and the previous two hands is that here <span class="tiles">v</span> already forms a completed set. In this situation <span class="tiles">q</span> and <span class="tiles">z</span> are basically the same in efficiency. Then, you should consider that, if you end up tenpai on a tile next to <span class="tiles">q</span> or <span class="tiles">z</span>, which one would be better? Because you already see 3 of the <span class="tiles">v</span>, other people will have a harder time making use of <span class="tiles">x</span> or <span class="tiles">c</span>. Therefore, if you intend to be riichi-ing with this hand, you should discard <span class="tiles">q</span>, aiming to potentially win on others' <span class="tiles">x</span> or <span class="tiles">c</span> discard. Some of you may be worried of holding on to too many tiles from the <span class="tiles">zv</span> suji, but there's no reason to worry about that if it's still the first turn.
        </p>
        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">tyuuizbm,aj777</span></div><div class="dora">
                            <div class="ruby ruby-center"><span class="tiles">,</span><div class="rt">Dora</div></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             Now let's look at <strong>D</strong>. Once upon a time it was thought that drawing <span class="tiles">c</span> would create a <span class="tiles">zcb</span> shape, and so <span class="tiles">a</span> would be the better discard. But from a simple tile efficiency standpoint, discarding <span class="tiles">z</span> still allows you to utilize <span class="tiles">c</span>, so you're only losing <span class="tiles">zx</span>. Discarding <span class="tiles">a</span> loses you <span class="tiles">asd</span>. Some people like to emphasize the benefits of the ryankan <span class="tiles">zcb</span> shape if you draw <span class="tiles">c</span>, but you won't lose the <span class="tiles">v</span> draw even if you discard <span class="tiles">z</span>: discarding <span class="tiles">z</span> only loses you the <span class="tiles">x</span> draw. Compared to the small benefit if the <span class="tiles">zcb</span> shape, the loss of tile efficiency by discarding <span class="tiles">a</span> is much larger. Discarding <span class="tiles">z</span> is more efficient here.
        </p>
        <p>
             Ryankan shapes are important when you want to make pinfu, but a hand like <strong>D</strong> cannot become pinfu to begin with, and indeed most hands are better suited for this playstyle.
