        <p>
             Please look at this table. This is from a match I played in 2014. I would advance to the final table with a first place finish. I would be tenpai if I discarded <span class="tiles">u</span>, waiting on the kanchan <span class="tiles">h</span>, which haven't been discarded yet. Since I needed to finish first in this game, a popular choice would be to riichi this hand at the first possible opportunity. But if you look carefully at the table, you'll notice some special things.
        </p>

        <p>
             First, the south-seat player, Murakami, clearly has an irregular hand<span id="footnote-tag-2"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-2" title="jump to footnote 2">[2]</a></span>. There's a high chance he has chanta, chiitoitsu, or kokushi-musou. There's not much we can read about his hand. The other two players discarded manzu first, followed by pinzu. They're likely to be holding on to lots of souzu. Also, the west player, Tokui, likely doesn't have tiles next to <span class="tiles">y</span>, and the north player, Sakurai, likely doesn't have tiles next to <span class="tiles">irw</span>. This means we can be hopeful of drawing manzu. In this game, I discarded <span class="tiles">j</span>, hoping to draw manzu. Although drawing <span class="tiles">i</span> would put me into furiten, <span class="tiles">yo</span> would be a pretty good wait regardless, good enough for this first-or-nothing game. Drawing <span class="tiles">h</span> is also not a problem. Even if two people are holding on to souzu, the <span class="tiles">afj</span> three-sided wait is good enough for a furiten riichi.
        </p>
        <p>
             The result of this hand: I drew <span class="tiles">y</span>, and declared riichi. Tokui, who had a great 1-shanten hand, drew and discarded <span class="tiles">i</span> during my ippatsu turn. With uradora the hand was worth 7700 points.
        </p>
        <p>
             By the way, when I discarded <span class="tiles">j</span> on turn 8, there were four <span class="tiles">yo</span> tiles, three <span class="tiles">ti</span> tiles, and one <span class="tiles">h</span> in the wall. Setting aside Murakami, who was going for chiitoitsu, Tokui and Sakurai both had hands that could make use of <span class="tiles">h</span>, but could not make use of any manzu tiles. The situation was exactly the way I read it to be.
        </p>
        <p>
             From the tiles that have been discarded, you can somewhat gain information about the tiles that are being held on to. Don't lose your mind thinking about how many tiles are visible. Rather, aim for the suit that looks easy to come out.
        </p>

                 Translator's note: this section talks about &ldquo;安い色&rdquo; (&ldquo;cheap suit&rdquo;), referring to a suit that is discarded a lot and thus easier to come out later, and &ldquo;高い色&rdquo; (&ldquo;expensive suits&rdquo;), the contrary where tiles are difficult to come out. Since I haven't seen the term used often in English mahjong discussion, I chose to rephrase this section in a way that avoids these words.

                 Translation of &ldquo;変則手&rdquo; (hensokute), referring to hands that do not progress &ldquo;normally&rdquo;. This can mean chiitoitsu or kokushi, which are not in the four-sets-and-a-pair shape. It can also mean honitsu or chanta, which require you to play against normal tile efficiency.
