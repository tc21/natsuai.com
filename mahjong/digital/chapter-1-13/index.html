             I often hear people say they don't like chiitoitsu because they choose the wrong tile. But you cannot avoid discarding pairs into your wall when making chiitoitsu. Although even the best mahjong players cannot avoid this, drawing a tile you've already discarded can still cause a mental impact. For those of you, please look at this chart.

             The above data refers to completed chiitoitsu hands. &ldquo;Number of Pairs Made&rdquo; refers to the total number of pairs in the winning hand, as well as the winner's discard pile. In other words, a no-miss chiitoitsu would be 7, and having three pairs in your discard pile would be 10.
        </p>

        <p>
             What do you think about this data? 18 out of 50, or about one third, of the wins are without any misses. Most of those hands were completed fairly quickly. The remaining 32 cases mostly have 8 to 9 completed pairs. If you average the data, chiitoitsu requires 7.8 pairs on average to win. Even in a high-level tournament like <em>Tenhou Meijinsen</em> a &ldquo;no-miss chiitoitsu&rdquo; happens about once every hundred hands. Also, this data doesn't count instances where <span id="footnote-tag-1">
                someone couldn't call ron because of their choice of wait<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a>
            </span>. If you counted those instances, a completed chiitoitsu hand probably uses around 9 pairs.
        </p>
        <p>
             Discarding a pair into your discard pile is not a technical mistake. Since you cannot tell what's printed on a covered mahjong tile, it's natural to have pairs in your discard pile. Disliking chiitoitsu because of such a reason would be too unreasonable.
        </p>

        <p>
             That said, collecting this data was such an endeavor. I looked at all of the point movements of each game, picked out all hands that could have been chiitoitsu, and manually counted how many pairs they made. I only found 50 completed chiitoitsu hands out of 180 hanchans, so the sample size might be a bit small, but if I can make the people who diskile chiitoitsu rethink their approach to this yaku, then the time and effort I put into this would have been worth it.<span id="footnote-tag-2">

                  Translator's note: This sentence might not be perfectly clear. &ldquo;Those instances&rdquo; refer to when you are tenpai for chiitoitsu: any turn you can choose between two tiles to wait on. If the tile you chose to discard is then dropped by someone else, you &ldquo;missed out on a win&rdquo;. Here we are talking about how the data only contains information from your own discard pile, and cannot account for such situations.

                 Translator's note: Tools and methods to collect large amounts of data have advanced since 2016, when Kobayashi collected this data. We should hopefully have better data now, if not in the future.
