             In this section, I want to talk about how to play in the east round, up until south 2, when you have a big lead.
        </p>
        <p>
             The term &ldquo;big lead&rdquo; refers to a lead of more than 25000 points over second place. You'll be fine even if you deal into 12000 points, or be hit by a 6000-all tsumo. In other words, your first place is basically confirmed. Many people want to advance the game without taking any risks at this point.
        </p>
        <p>
             However, mahjong isn't just a game of placement. It's about placement and points combined. If you're basically confirmed as first, then all you have left to do is earn points. Keep in mind that trying to earn points isn't just going for big hands. As if it was East 1, don't think about placement, and just play mahjong normally. For example, with the hand shown below, don't think about being safe by staying damaten. Declare riichi for more value. Get 1000 points out of a 1000-point hand, get a mangan out of a mangan hand. Your decision on which tiles to push, and which tiles to not push should be the same as always.
        </p>

                <div class="hand compact">
                    <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">wwrtynnmm,,gh</span></div><div class="dora">

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
             When you have a lead between 10000 and 25000 points, then you must be very aware of the fact that you're top. Although you are unlikely to fall from top seat with just one hand, your opponents can get close to you with just a single hand. With such a lead, you should focus on safely ending each hand and advancing the game. As long as you have a yaku, you should forget about making your hand bigger, and focus on not drawing attention of your opponents, and winning you hand as quickly as possible. Additionally, since dealing into a big hand all but eliminates your lead, you should be very careful of opponents' calls and riichis, and avoid dealing no matter what. The less hands that remain, the less your opponents have a chance to overtake you, and the more likely you will finish in first.
        </p>
        <p>
             If your lead is even smaller, at less than 10000 points, then instead you must be careful not to be overly conscious of being top. If you don't win hands to escape to outside of your opponents' hitting range, you risk being overtaken by a single tsumo. Don't be too conscious of your placement, and just play normally.
        </p>
