             A potential junchan-sanshoku riichi, but the <span class="tiles">v</span>, which makes your hand riichi-nomi, comes out. Do you take this ron?
        </p>
        <p>
             Drawing <span class="tiles">z</span> is worth 18000 points. Adding an uradora makes 24000 points. Some people would definitely want to pass this up. But before that, we must calculate how many points we would gain by declaring ron here.
        </p>
        <p>
             What we have might look like 2000 points, but counting uradora, the hand is worth approximately 2900 points. We have also put in a riichi stick. Although we put out this riichi stick, once it's put out there, it stops belonging to anyone in particular. In summary, winning the hand here nets you 3900 points, compared to not winning the hand.
        </p>
        <p>
             The value of your hand, if you pass up this ron and still win, would be 13000 points on average, considering both the <span class="tiles">z</span> draw and <span class="tiles">v</span> draw. A 9000-point gain compared to saying ron here. That's still a lot of points, but I don't think that's enough to pass up on 4000 points in this kind of a point situation. Anyhow, with only 12 draws, the chances of winning this hand isn't high even with a ryanmen wait. The chances of drawing the desired <span class="tiles">z</span> is only half of that. Considering all that, it's more worthwhile to take the ron here.
        </p>
        <p>
             That said, situations where you would pass up on such a win, while extremely rare, do exist. That is, during South 3 or South 4, when winning 2000 points would keep you in second place, but winning a mangan takes you into first. In such a situation, the mangan is worth more than 8000 points. In general, many rulesets award you 20000 or 40000 points for finishing in first compared to second. That number would be added to the value of the mangan, which can make it a worthwhile bet to give up the 2000-point win.
