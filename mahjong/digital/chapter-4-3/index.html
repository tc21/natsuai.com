             Discarding the safe tile <span class="tiles">4</span> gets us to tenpai. Our hand is pinfu-nomi. We have two more draws. Since it's late game, many people would choose to damaten. Perhaps you are wary of losing the ability to defend with a 2000-point riichi-pinfu, but let's think about it.
        </p>

        <p>
             In mahjong, there is ippatsu and uradora. With 2 turns remaining, winning on the first turn means a minimum of 3900 points with ippatsu, and tsumo would turn it into 5200 points. If we hit an uradora, we have a mangan. In other words, this late riichi is worth 1.8-2 han considering ippatsu and uradora<span id="footnote-tag-1"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
             If our opponents get to tenpai and declare an expensive riichi after we do, we still have a good wait, and our hand is bigger, so we're not in a disadvantage. Even if we stayed in damaten, we are not guaranteed to be able to avoid dealing in. Also, opponents not yet in tenpai are less likely to attack our 2-han riichi. Even if they get into tenpai on the last turn, if they have to discard a dangerous tile, there is a good chance they decide to bail. Declaring riichi certainly causes less people to be in tenpai at ryuukyoku.
        </p>
        <p>
             Let's look at the table again. Everyone is closed. In the third row of discards, no one has caught our attention by discarding particularly dangerous tiles. The dealer is playing and discarding normally, but we can't be sure they are tenpai. The other players are reacting to the dealer with their discards. Therefore we should declare riichi. The value of our hand shoots up, and we also increase our expected gained tenpai payments by forcing south and north seat into noten. If we ended up missing out on a 1000-point pinfu-nomi win, and we end up losing our riichi stick, we will still get tenpai payments, so that's not a problem.
        </p>
        <p>
             However, if our wait is bad, if there is already a riichi on the table, or if we see an obviously dangerous honiitsu or toitoi, things would be different. Stay in damaten and use your hand to ruin your opponent's hand, and also be able to keep dangerous tiles that come your way.
        </p>

                 Translator's note: due to the same reasons, a normal riichi is typically worth around 1.3-1.4 han.
