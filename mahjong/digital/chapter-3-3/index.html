             It's turn 6, and you have the above tanyao-nomi 1-shanten hand. What discards from kamicha would you call?
        </p>
        <p>
             I think most people would call <span class="tiles">c</span>. Calling away the kanchan <span class="tiles">c</span> makes your hand strong. What about <span class="tiles">fj</span>? In the last section, we talked about how keeping a bad shape (like kanchan) in your hand means you don't get close to winning, so you shouldn't start calling from good shapes. But what about now?
        </p>
        <p>
             The answer is to call. Although you will still have a bad kanchan <span class="tiles">c</span> tenpai, when you are tenpai, you can call &ldquo;ron&rdquo;. You can only call chii from kamicha, but you can call ron from anyone. The best way to take care of the bad shape is to win off it, so we should get to tenpai as quickly as we can.
        </p>

        <p>
             In addition, you might think that you've built your hand to this point, calling and making it worth only 1000 points isn't worth it. But you only have 3 tiles you can draw to get into tenpai. Calculating the probabilities, you have an about 40% chance to get to tenpai by turn 10, and 60% by turn 13. It isn't that easy to draw, even if you have 3 choices. Even if your hand does advance closed, you are more likely to draw <span class="tiles">fj</span> first and wait on the kanchan <span class="tiles">c</span>. Rather than being able to declare a <span class="tiles">fj</span> riichi when you draw <span class="tiles">c</span>, it's better to actually win a 300/500 hand<span id="footnote-tag-1"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span>.
        </p>
        <p> What if we changed the shape a little?</p>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="hand-container">
                <div class="hand compact">
                    <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">iiixv,,dfghj4</span></div><div class="dora">
                        <div class="ruby ruby-center"><span class="tiles">z</span><div class="rt">Dora</div></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
             Just like before, you should call <span class="tiles">c</span> as well as <span class="tiles">sgk</span> to get to tenpai. Even if you stay closed, you are likely to draw souzu first and end up waiting on the <span class="tiles">c</span> kanchan.
        </p>
        <p>
             If you are the type who feels bad about calling a 3-sided shape to wait on kanchan, I want you to take this opportunity to change the way you think. The way to become a winner in mahjong is to throw away &ldquo;bad feelings&rdquo; and think about the profits and losses of each move.
        </p>

                  I hope this sentence isn't too confusing. What Kobayashi is comparing is the situation if your next (useful) draw is <span class="tiles">c</span>. If you hadn't called, you would be able to declare a <span class="tiles">fj</span> riichi. If you had called, you would win by tsumo.
