        <p>
             Most people nowadays play mahjong with the concept of &ldquo;placement points&rdquo;. In general, this means that when a hanchan ends, your score is not only the points you have, but points are added or subtracted depending on your placement.
        </p>
        <p>
             I'll be talking about placement points in Mahjong Saikyosen's &ldquo;25000-point start, 30000-point return, 10/30 uma&rdquo;. This should be representative of a typical placement point configuration.
        </p>


        <p>
             What does it mean to start with 25000 points and return 30000 points? Your score is calculated based on 30000 points, but before the game starts, everyone takes 5000 points and puts it somewhere outside the table, so you start with 25000 points. When the game ends, the 20000 extra points goes to the player in first place. This 20000 points is called oka<span id="footnote-tag-1"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
             Next is uma<span id="footnote-tag-2"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-2" title="jump to footnote 2">[2]</a></span>. Uma refers to points added to or subtracted from a player's score based on their finishing position. Saikyosen uses a 10/30 (also called one/three) uma, meaning that from first place each player gets +30000, +10000, &minus;10000, &minus;30000 points. This is based on the concept of you betting 10000 points against each of your three opponents. First place beats all three opponents, and wins 30000 points. Second place beats two opponents but loses against one, winning 10000 points, and so forth.
        </p>
        <p>
             The combination of oka and uma is called placements points. In general, 1000 points in mahjong is equivalent to 1 placement score. This chart shows the placement points Saikyosen uses.

             For example, if you had 46700 points and was in first place, your base points is +16.7. Your placement points is +50, so your total score is +66.7. Since the +50 bonus for first place is equivalent to 50000 points, usually it's much more important to finish in first place than to simply win big hands.

                 Oka comes from the word &ldquo;丘&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;mound, hill&rdquo;, likely referring to the &ldquo;mound&rdquo; of point-sticks made by the 20000 points. According to <a href="http://npm2001.com/kouza.html"> Nihon Pro Mahjong</a>'s explanation, this rule originated from a time where, when playing in mahjong parlors, the player finishing first was responsible for all four players' entry fees.

                 Uma probably comes from the word &ldquo;馬&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;horse&rdquo;. In horse racing, placement is called uma. No one's really sure, but this is likely where the word comes from.
