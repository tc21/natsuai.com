        <p> Let's continue talking about &ldquo;equal probabilities&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>
             Let me say the important thing once again. Precise probabilities, such as in &ldquo;with one winning raffle ticket, if all other conditions are equal, drawing out of 3 tickets, the probability of drawing the winning one is 1 out of 3&rdquo;, do not exist in mahjong. There are 136 mahjong tiles. As soon as a human being with some thought process reveals some of the tiles, the remaining wall is no longer fully random, and the probability of drawing any two tiles are no longer equal. Since probabilities are no longer equal, the answer to &ldquo;which wait is more likely to tsumo&rdquo; can only be &ldquo;we don't know&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
             When someone shows you a what should you discard question, they often add in X tile has been cut Y times. I'm sure those people are treating the tiles on the board the same as the tiles in their hands.
        </p>
        <p>
             Unfortunately, I won't be part of those conversations. It's impossible to talk about mahjong involving probability theory with those people. Consequently, when I think about &ldquo;number of tiles remaining&rdquo; or &ldquo;what will the ura-dora be&rdquo;, I only look at my own hand and discards. Everything else is considered &ldquo;things I can't see&rdquo;.
        </p>

             This is a hand I had in <em>Tenhou Meijinsen</em>. As the last-place dealer in South 3, my starting hand had 4 pairs, and I called the non-value <span class="tiles">4</span> and <span class="tiles">3</span>. The only <span class="tiles">2</span> and <span class="tiles">6</span> I see are the one each in my hand, and the dora indicator. Could I simply think of the 5 remaining <span class="tiles">2</span> and <span class="tiles">6</span> as all being in the wall? Thinking from the perspective of other players, you can't say <span class="tiles">6</span> is is easier to come out, but no doubt with my calls <span class="tiles">1</span> and <span class="tiles">2</span> are harder to discard, thus the chances that <span class="tiles">2</span> is in someone's hand becomes higher.
        </p>
        <p>
             Later I called <span class="tiles">c</span> and discarded <span class="tiles">6</span>. I waited on the <span class="tiles">2</span> that I can't be sure exists in the wall, because I wanted to slow down other people's hands. Even if I don't tsumo, I can get another hand if the hand goes to ryuukyoku. Later, since <span class="tiles">y</span> and <span class="tiles">u</span> were pretty much all out, I switched to the better-looking <span class="tiles">i</span>, and won by ron. Mahjong is a game like this, where you cannot simply say &ldquo;I don't see it, and therefore it's in the wall&rdquo;, or &ldquo;it's not in the wall, so it's a bad wait&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
             I am not disavowing the act of using discarded tiles as reference. If a tile has been discarded 4 times or discarded 3 times early on, and only then, are they clearly less present in the wall, and I use such information quite often. It's important to use the information on the board to imagine what the wall and other people's hands might be. What I disagree with is looking at the numbers and just using them as-is.
        </p>
        <p>
             It's really easy for commentators and analysts broadcasting a match to say &ldquo;X tile is cut Y times&rdquo;. But for you the viewer, please do not be misled by such cheap information.
