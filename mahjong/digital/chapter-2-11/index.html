        <p> Following up on the last section, let's talk about playing while keeping calm.</p>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="hand-container">
                <div class="hand compact">
                    <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">rtcbbnmdfgkk6</span></div><div class="dora">

             Take the hand above. You called the <span class="tiles">v</span> from kamicha to enter into a sanshoku tenpai, and then shimocha tsumogiri discarded the same <span class="tiles">v</span>! In other words, had you not called, you would have drawn into a tanyao-pinfu-sanshoku tenpai. This is also nothing to worry about. All that matters is the fact that you decided to advance your hand and are now in tenpai, and the fact that shimocha drew a tile they didn't want and discarded it. You can ask yourself, &ldquo;Was this hand worth calling?&rdquo;, but there's no reason to think &ldquo;the next draw was <span class="tiles">v</span>&rdquo;, which is something that cannot predict.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="hand-container">
                <div class="hand compact">
                    <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">ertcvbbnghjkk</span></div><div class="dora">
                        <div class="ruby ruby-center"><span class="tiles">s</span><div class="rt">Dora</div></div>

        <p>
             You are tenpai for tanyao-pinfu. Usually you would declare riichi, but there are so many <span class="tiles">vm</span> discarded, that you decided to damaten. Then you drew the winning tile the next turn!
        </p>
        <p> &ldquo;Ahh, with riichi and ippatsu this would be a mangan. If I then got an ura...&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
             Do not think like this. This was not a hand worth declaring riichi, so you thought you would be lucky to win 2000 points with this hand. Instead, the 700-1300 hand gave you 2700 points. This is a situation to be happy about, not disappointed. To begin with, had you declared riichi, your opponents would have reacted differently, and you wouldn't necessarily tsumo.
        </p>
        <p>
             How did you think, reading up until now? Perhaps up until now you have thought of these kinds of events as accidents. Are you able to understand that you really don't need to care a lot about them?
        </p>
        <p>
             If you wanted to know why I didn't talk about techniques in these last two sections, but talked about mentality, it's because there are many mahjong players who easily lose composure, and end up not playing to their true level. May be your skill level was 100, but something caused you to lose your composure, and you end up playing at only 50. Many people are like that. No matter how good you are at making hands or reading other people's hands, it's meaningless if you can't play to your own ability.
        </p>
        <p>
             While trying as hard as you can to level up from 100 to 105 is also important, if instead you could make sure no matter the circumstances you were able to play at about 80, your results will vastly improve. Try to stay calm at all times, and be composed, in order to make the best decisions.
