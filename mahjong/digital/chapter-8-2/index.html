             Let's continue talking about furiten. Assume we are the dealer, and we have to win this hand. What should we discard from the following hand?
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="hand-container">
                <div class="hand compact">
                    <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">ryyuvbnm.as567</span></div><div class="dora">
                        <div class="ruby ruby-center"><span class="tiles">a</span><div class="rt">Dora</div></div>
                    </div>

        <p>
             Where will we find four sets? Where will we find a yaku? We want to draw a yakuhai pair. We also don't want to discard <span class="tiles">r</span>, which would prevent us from developing our manzu tiles. That said we can't break up one of our souzu or pinzu sets either... What should we discard, when we don't want to discard anything?
        </p>
        <p>
             The answer is <span class="tiles">.</span>. It keeps every possibility alive. The only problem is drawing <span class="tiles">,</span>. Some people might think, &ldquo;Oh no! I failed!&rdquo; but creating an easily-completed <span class="tiles">cn.</span> shape isn't a failure, but rather getting about 70% of the way to two completed sets. For example, drawing <span class="tiles">d</span> gets you a 100%-completed set, but drawing <span class="tiles">,</span> (after discarding <span class="tiles">.</span>) gets you similar value. If you then consider the possibility of drawing any of the three yakuhai, or extending our manzu shape, discarding <span class="tiles">.</span> gives us the least amount of loss while advancing towards winning this hand.
        </p>
        <p>
             Those of you who hate furiten with a passion might not have even thought about this discard, but I want you to be able to understand that drawing <span class="tiles">,</span> still gets your hand closer to winning.
        </p>
        <p>
             In a similar vein, let's look that this hand. You've already discarded <span class="tiles">.</span>. What should you discard?
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="hand-container">
                <div class="hand compact">
                    <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">wwrtyuvbnmsdfj</span></div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
             Some people will try to avoid furiten, and create the 567 sanshoku, and discard <span class="tiles">v</span>. But please compare the amount of effective tiles here. The effective souzu tiles are <span class="tiles">g</span> through <span class="tiles">l</span>, while the ones you would be happy with are just <span class="tiles">hk</span>, which create ryanmen, and <span class="tiles">g</span>, which create sanshoku. On the other hand, the effective pinzu tiles are <span class="tiles">x</span> through <span class="tiles">.</span>. You would be happy with <span class="tiles">bn</span> as well as <span class="tiles">c</span>, which would create a three-sided wait. Even if you drew <span class="tiles">,</span>, a furiten three-sided wait isn't bad. With such a huge difference in tile efficiency, and a fightable hand even if you draw <span class="tiles">,</span>, you should discard <span class="tiles">j</span>.

             In a kuttsuki<span id="footnote-tag-1"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span> 1-shanten, sometimes some of your draws might create a furiten. Rather than avoiding furiten at all costs, try to choose between tiles while considering all of your possibilities.

                 &ldquo;Kuttsuki&rdquo; (くっつき, lit. to adhere to) refers to having multiple unrelated tiles, and hoping to advance your hand by drawing next to those tiles, and waiting on the tile/tiles you didn't draw. For example, if you kept <span class="tiles">j</span> in the hand above, you would be tenpai if you drew any tile next to <span class="tiles">j</span>.
