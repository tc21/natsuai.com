        <p>
             This hand is a <span class="tiles">xb</span> and <span class="tiles">af</span> 1-shanten, after calling <span class="tiles">6</span> and the dora <span class="tiles">2</span><span id="footnote-tag-1"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span>. It was easy to get to this point, but we've been guarded against ever since. The other players are playing defensively, and kamicha has been exclusively playing safe tiles, trying to prevent us from calling anything. In this situation, we drew <span class="tiles">d</span>. Discarding <span class="tiles">3</span> gives us better tile efficiency. What should we do?
        </p>
        <p>
             If we discard <span class="tiles">3</span> here, we are likely to discard <span class="tiles">d</span> when we get to tenpai. But discarding <span class="tiles">g</span> early, and then a <span class="tiles">d</span> tedashi signals that we are waiting next to that tile, and we won't be able to ron <span class="tiles">af</span>. On the other hand, if we tsumogiri <span class="tiles">d</span>, and then tedashi <span class="tiles">3</span>, people are likely to read that we don't have an incomplete shape near <span class="tiles">d</span>. They are unlikely to expect a <span class="tiles">af</span> wait. By the way, if we draw <span class="tiles">af</span> first and wait on <span class="tiles">xb</span>, then our sakigiri of <span class="tiles">d</span> would have no effect.
        </p>
        <p>
             Another thing to pay attention to is toimen discarding <span class="tiles">a</span> just now. If we tsumogiri here, there's a possibility that kamicha might play <span class="tiles">a</span>, giving us opportunity to chii. If we tedashi a tile, then perhaps <span class="tiles">a</span> won't come out anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
             Of course, if we discard <span class="tiles">d</span>, we won't be able to use <span class="tiles">o</span> and <span class="tiles">d</span> anymore. Missing out on a pon or triplet draw into tenpai is not a small loss.
        </p>
        <p>
             Even so, I recommend tsumogiri <span class="tiles">d</span>. Although we don't want to miss out on drawing <span class="tiles">o</span> or <span class="tiles">d</span>, the better possibility of calling chii or ron on <span class="tiles">zv</span> is a much larger benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
             If you're playing with three other players that don't pay any attention to tedashi and tsumogiri, of course it would be better to discard <span class="tiles">3</span>. However, the stronger your opponents are, the more effective this tsumogiri becomes. This technique is effective precisely because it hurts your tile efficiency.
        </p>

                 Due to technical limitations, this is not shown in the graphic, but the <span class="tiles">6</span> is called from shimocha's 3rd discard, and the <span class="tiles">2</span> is called from toimen's 5th discard.
