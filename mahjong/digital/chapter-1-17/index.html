             What should you do when you see a potential chiitoitsu, when chiitoitsu can't be five blocks?
        </p>
        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">qqyuxcm,,fgg77</span></div><div class="dora">
                            <div class="ruby"><span class="tiles">w</span><div class="rt">Dora</div></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             Let's look at hand <strong>A</strong>. You have enough blocks, but not any completed sets. This is 3-shanten for a normal hand. You have four pairs, so it's 2-shanten for chiitoitsu. Although you want to enable both chiitoitsu and a standard hand, you have so many ryanmen shapes, as well as a yakuhai pair. Breaking up a ryanmen for chiitoitsu would be too wasteful. We will have to choose to use our ryanmen shapes, and give up on chiitoitsu. You can discard <span class="tiles">q</span>, <span class="tiles">,</span>, or <span class="tiles">g</span>. Which one should you discard?
        </p>
        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">qqyuxcm,fgg77</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             Discarding <span class="tiles">,</span> results in hand <strong>B</strong>. This looks like a good shape, but it already has six blocks.  If you want to win, you have to break up one of the blocks. Most likely you will have to discard <span class="tiles">qq</span> from this hand. Might as well have discarded <span class="tiles">qq</span> to begin with, holding on to the five strongest blocks.
        </p>
        <p>
             In other words, discarding <span class="tiles">,</span> or <span class="tiles">g</span> to give up on chiitoitsu probably means you will break up the <span class="tiles">q</span> pair as well, making chiitoitsu basically impossible. On the other hand, breaking up the <span class="tiles">q</span> pair means you have space for an extra tile in your hand, and you could possibly draw a pair again, causing you to rethink your plan of going with a standard hand. For example, if you drew <span class="tiles">u</span> and <span class="tiles">c</span>, you would end up with the following hand.
        </p>
        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">yuuxccm,,fgg77</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             All of a sudden, we are 1-shanten for chiitoitsu which we once decided to give up on. This hand is still 3-shanten for a normal hand, we should probably switch to prioritizing chiitoitsu here, and think about which unpaired tile to discard. This way, we discarded a pair from hand <strong>A</strong>, but still kept the possibility of chiitoitsu alive. Discarding <span class="tiles">,</span> or <span class="tiles">g</span> would never be able to achieve this. Please remember this shape.
