             Techniques to make it difficult for others to guess your wait have long been studied in mahjong. An often used technique is camouflaging your wait by throwing a lot of tiles of the same suit. For example, throwing <span class="tiles">vc</span> early on, and then waiting on <span class="tiles">xb</span>. Another one is the suji trap, where, after throwing <span class="tiles">b</span>, you wait on the suji <span class="tiles">x</span>. Also, there are techniques where you make people think you have a honiitsu but actually are waiting on another suit. Here, I'll introduce a way to wait on tiles that your opponent might not expect when you open your hand.

        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents">
                            <span class="tiles">iiccvbbkkk<span class="separated sideways">T</span>ry</span>
                        </div><div class="dora">
                            <div class="ruby ruby-center"><span class="tiles">k</span><div class="rt">Dora</div></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             How do you call in a way that conceals your wait? Hand <strong>A</strong> is a tanyao-dora 3 tenpai with one call. Since the <span class="tiles">v</span> kanchan is a bad wait, we want to make it better.
        </p>
        <p>
             The first thing that comes to mind is drawing <span class="tiles">n</span> and discarding <span class="tiles">c</span> for a <span class="tiles">vm</span> wait. Also drawing <span class="tiles">c</span> and discarding <span class="tiles">b</span> for a <span class="tiles">cnk</span> wait, or drawing <span class="tiles">b</span> and discarding <span class="tiles">c</span> for a <span class="tiles">xbk</span> wait. Additionally, calling or drawing <span class="tiles">,</span> allows you to choose between a <span class="tiles">xb</span> or <span class="tiles">cn</span> wait.
        </p>
        <p>
             And then, what you cannot miss is calling pon on <span class="tiles">c</span> or <span class="tiles">b</span>. If you call <span class="tiles">b</span> and discard <span class="tiles">c</span>, your wait becomes <span class="tiles">xb</span>. Although the number of tiles you wait on don't increase, consider that to your opponents, your hand looks like <strong>B</strong>, and your discard pile looks like <strong>C</strong>.

        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents">

                        </div><div class="dora">
                            <div class="ruby ruby-center"><span class="tiles">k</span><div class="rt">Dora</div></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">4q.7ajw5c</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             You discarded <span class="tiles">w</span> after calling <span class="tiles">t</span>, and discarded <span class="tiles">c</span> after calling <span class="tiles">b</span>. What would you think this hand is, and what would you think it's waiting on?
        </p>
        <p>
             The yaku is probably tanyao. discarding the dora indicator <span class="tiles">j</span> means a completed set containing dora. It looks like you've taken care of a manzu ryankan shape and a pinzu <span class="tiles">cbb</span> shape. The most likely waits are probably <span class="tiles">sg</span> or <span class="tiles">dh</span>. Of course, there are many other cases, but this kind of read is typical. In other words, their first instinct is something like hand <strong>D</strong>, and it's easy to be blind to the possibility of waiting on the same <span class="tiles">b</span> that you just used to complete a set.
        </p>

            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">

                        </div><div class="dora">
                            <div class="ruby ruby-center"><span class="tiles">k</span><div class="rt">Dora</div></div>

                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             Usually, the more you call, the more people are wary of your hand. But by doing this you can make your opponents think, &ldquo;souzu is difficult to discard, but they've just finished their pinzu set&rdquo;, and make your wait more likely to come out.
        </p>
        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">rrriiccbbgghj</span></div><div class="dora">
                            <div class="ruby ruby-center"><span class="tiles">r</span><div class="rt">Dora</div></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             Quite often your opponents won't think of tiles you've already called as dangerous, and discard them. For example, with hand <strong>E</strong> you should definitely call <span class="tiles">v</span> into tenpai.
        </p>
