             You cannot talk about modern mahjong tactics without talking about riichi. In the past it was only used for hands people were very confident in winning, but recently we have been able to see the value of riichi in a new light.
        </p>
        <p>
             The advantage to declaring riichi is the 1 additional han, as well as putting pressure on your opponents by letting them know you are tenpai. The drawbacks are not being able to react to changes on the table, and having people react and defend against you.
        </p>
        <p>
             We will talk separately about how to use riichi when you don't have a yaku, and when you have a yaku.
        </p>
        <p>
             First up is when you don't have a yaku. Since you only gain the ability to win off of others by declaring riichi, most of the time it is beneficial to do so. With a good wait such as a ryanmen or a shanpon of honor tiles, you should definitely riichi. Even if your wait isn't great, if you don't have a lot of ways to improve your hand you should riichi. The only cases where you wouldn't riichi without a yaku, is when your wait is bad, and you have many ways to improve your hand, such as in example <strong>A</strong>.

             But things are different when you already have a yaku. Declaring riichi with a hand that you could stay damaten in is intentionally telling your opponents that you are tenpai, likely making winning your hand more difficult. To make up for this drawback, you need to correspondingly increase the value of your hand, or else the riichi would be pointless. For example, hand <strong>B</strong> is 2000 points when damaten, but with riichi, tsumo, ippatsu, uradora, etc. you can expect a 3900-8000 point hand. Although you are less likely to win, you get enough value in return that this is a good riichi. Hand <strong>C</strong> is much more delicate. An 8000-point damaten hand. Declaring riichi, the hand is still between 8000-12000 points. Compared to the increased value, the loss when you are unable to win is more significant. Declaring riichi makes your hand instantly stand out, meaning you are quite likely to miss out on a win, so it makes sense to damaten here.
        </p>

             But all this is just common sense about riichi. I will touch on more detailed and intricate situations in the following sections.
