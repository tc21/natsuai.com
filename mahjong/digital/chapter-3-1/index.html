             The methods of making a set in mahjong, in addition to drawing from the wall, are pon, chii, kan, and ron. If you draw the entirety of your 4 sets and a pair, you get 1 han for &ldquo;<span id="footnote-tag-1">menzen<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span> tsumo&rdquo;, and if you are one step away from that you hand is called &ldquo;menzen&rdquo;, and you can get a yaku by declaring riichi. With the privilege of declaring riichi by staying closed, the general way of thinking is &ldquo;generally, mahjong is to stay closed, and declare riichi when you are tenpai&rdquo;. And thus there are even some people that think calling is only reserved for extraordinary circumstances.

             I very much doubt this way of thinking. My way of thinking is &ldquo;generally, mahjong is 4 sets and 1 pair&rdquo;. Basically, mahjong is a game of completing your hand before everyone else. Sometimes, you can get to tenpai drawing everything yourself, and as a bonus, you get &ldquo;the privilege of staying closed&rdquo;. The main benefit of calling is you get to tenpai faster. The main drawbacks are giving away information about your hand, and having less tiles to choose from later on. You can make use of calling as long as you understand that.
        </p>
        <p>
             That said, it's true that many people think, &ldquo;If my hand gets too short, it'll be difficult to defend. That's scary so I wont call.&rdquo; But think about it. With a hand you are trying to win, you won't bail, so you don't have to think about not being able to defend. In addition, after calling once, with 10 tiles in your hand, you still have many choices, and your ability to defend isn't lowered that much. Since you're closer to winning, it might all work out in the end. Even if you call 4 times, you would still have two tiles to choose from every turn. That is still a lot more freedom than if you progressed you hand closed, and declared riichi.

             By the way, and you'll understand this if you actually play in some Chinese rules that don't need a yaku to win, they call much more eagerly than in Japanese rules that has 1-han shibari. They don't think that mahjong is &ldquo;generally closed&rdquo;, instead they call all the time, thinking &ldquo;if I don't make a set here, I won't be able to win&rdquo;, and think about how to find a yaku while their hand gets shorter, and win more often because of that.
        </p>
        <p>
             Calling is a way of drawing a tile from someone else's discards to definitely complete a set, rather than relying on a tile that may or may not exist in the wall. Call liberally to complete you hands.

             By the way, the kanji of the word &ldquo;menzen&rdquo; is &ldquo;門前&rdquo; (technically &ldquo;<span id="footnote-tag-2">門前清<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-2" title="jump to footnote 2">[2]</a></span>&rdquo;, <em>menzenchin</em>). If you think of the 4 players' hands as <span id="footnote-tag-3">4 gates surrounding an intersection<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-3" title="jump to footnote 3">[3]</a></span>, then the situation of having no called tiles by the gate can be called &ldquo;clean in front of the gate&rdquo;. This is where the term comes from. If you're typing the word in Japanese, don't accidentally use the identical-sounding &ldquo;面前&rdquo;.

                  Translator's note: I can inject some personal knowledge since I grew up in China. Gates called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paifang"> <em>Paifang</em> or <em>Pailou</em></a> are often used in China to mark the entry point of a community or other important places. Some extra-important intersections, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongsi_Subdistrict,_Beijing"> <em>Dongsi</em></a> in Beijing, was famously surrounded by 4 such gates (<a href="https://natsuai.com/static/assets/dongsi.jpg">link to image</a>).
