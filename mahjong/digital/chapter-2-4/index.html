             As the dealer, low on points, you are tenpai of iipeikou-nomi. You are waiting on 3p, but it's a bad wait: you have one in your hand, and there is one already discarded. Many people would decide to damaten here to secure this hand first, and hope to do something in the following hand. I would declare riichi here. We are in need of points here. Rather than putting your hope on the possibility of a next hand we don't know anything about, it's much simpler to get a mangan with riichi, tsumo, and an uradora. If this is a hand that's difficult to win either way, we'd rather make this hand as big as possible when we win. Rather than betting on the next hand, which carries an expected value of 500 points, we should increase this value of the current hand as much as we can.
        </p>
        <p> With what we've talked about so far, let's rethink about the following tactics.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                1500 point tenpai with a bad wait. <span id="footnote-tag-1">Zentsuppa<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span> to protect the dealership. <br> &rarr; A bad idea. Placing too much expectation on the next hand to the point of hurting (expected value of) the current hand is unacceptable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Tenpai of pinfu-dora 2. Damaten to protect the dealership. <br> &rarr; This is a valuable hand that you would riichi for 8000 points as non-dealer. Settling for 5800 points as the dealer is nonsense. Making big hands is exactly the point of the dealer having the privilege of hands that are 50% larger. Rather than making your hand smaller for a better chance of continuing your dealership, it's a lot better to aim for 12000 points here.
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">ioozxx..hhk77</span></div><div class="dora">
                            <div class="ruby ruby-center"><span class="tiles">6</span><div class="rt">Dora</div></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div> Rather than just going for chiitoitsu, call <span class="tiles">.</span> and go for toitoi, because you're the dealer. <br> &rarr; This is alright. A hand that looks big from the dealer puts a lot of pressure on the other players, making it more difficult for them to make their hands, and less likely to hit you with a big hand.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             Let me repeat this: The value of a dealership is around 500 points. You should be prioritizing playing the current hand correctly, rather than trying to continue your dealership no matter what.
        </p>
