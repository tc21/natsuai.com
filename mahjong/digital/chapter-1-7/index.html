             With hand <strong>A</strong>, what tiles will take you into tenpai? Two sets are confirmed already, so you only need to think about <span class="tiles">mm,sd44</span>. One more complete set here makes you tenpai, so <span class="tiles">n.</span> or <span class="tiles">af</span>, or <span class="tiles">m4</span> to create a triplet. This type of hand, with two ryanmen shapes and a shanpon shape is called &ldquo;perfect 1-shanten&rdquo;. This is a really good shape. Please remember it.

             What should you discard from hand <strong>B</strong>? If you wanted to make a hand like <strong>A</strong>, you should discard <span class="tiles">u</span> or <span class="tiles">c</span>. There's not much difference between the two, however since a wait closer to the edge is better, it's better to discard <span class="tiles">c</span> to make the <span class="tiles">zv</span> wait more likely.
        </p>
        <p>
             How about <strong>C</strong>? Some people might want to keep all of their ryanmen shapes and discard <span class="tiles">c</span>. Then you hand becomes <strong>D</strong>. <span class="tiles">ti</span> and <span class="tiles">zv</span> would make you tenpai, but <span class="tiles">gk</span> doesn't put you into tenpai even though you kept the ryanmen shape. There is no reason to keep a ryanmen shape that doesn't put you into tenpai. Instead, think about utilizing a potential <span class="tiles">h</span> or <span class="tiles">c</span> draw and discard <span class="tiles">j</span>.
        </p>
        <ol class="example-list">

            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
             Let's think about a slightly more complicated situation with a potential iipeikou. Hand <strong>E</strong> has three pairs, so let's break up one of the pairs in the pinzu or souzu. Usually you would want to discard <span class="tiles">k</span> to maximize your iipeikou potential. But to prioritize speed, you could also discard <span class="tiles">c</span>: there's more of <span class="tiles">zv</span> than <span class="tiles">fj</span>, not to mention <span class="tiles">zv</span> being easier to come out.<span id="footnote-tag-2"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-2" title="jump to footnote 2">[2]</a></span> Hand <strong>F</strong> has two pairs, so you want to confirm one of them as a pair. Usually you would discard <span class="tiles">x</span> for iipeikou, but when prioritizing speed you would discard <span class="tiles">h</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
             Regardless, remember that when your hand looks close to a perfect 1-shanten, you should keep two pairs in your hand.

                 &ldquo;1-shanten&rdquo;, or &ldquo;iishanten&rdquo;, meaning one tile away from tenpai. Also, the capitalization would have been extremely misleading if I used <code>Iishanten</code>.

                  (Translator's note: a basic explanation for beginners here: To get to tenpai, you must complete one of the three shapes in your hand: <span class="tiles">uu</span>, <span class="tiles">xcc</span>, or <span class="tiles">ggh</span>. In addition to <span class="tiles">zv</span> being a better wait than <span class="tiles">fj</span> for being closer to the edges, there is already a <span class="tiles">j</span> in your hand (and thus one less remaining). By discarding <span class="tiles">c</span> here, you make the <span class="tiles">ggh</span> easier to complete, and the <span class="tiles">xc</span> harder to complete. Although there is not instantaneous tile efficiency differences here, on average your wait will be better.
