             This is a book on digital mahjong, as evident by its title. In general, this means there's not a lot of room (or need, for that matter) for me to input my own opinion. However, as the translator/editor, I feel the need to talk a little bit about the next two chapters, as well as my motivation for translating this book.
        </p>
        <p>
             If you can confidently call your self a competent mahjong player, feel free to skip this foreword. I'll mainly talk about how some of the next two chapters might be a little on the advanced side of things.
        </p>
        <p>
             In my opinion, getting better at mahjong involves quite a bit of practice, and experience. Basic tile safety, basic tile efficiency. This book is almost like a collection of tips, once you've mastered those &ldquo;basics&rdquo;. Originally, I intended on picking out sections from another book, <em>Textbook on Mahjong Techniques - How to Win Efficiently</em> (<em>Mahjong Gijyutsu no Kyokasho - Koritsuteki na Agarikata</em>, Ide Yosuke, Kobayashi Go, 2016). The book is one for complete beginners, and I needed to pick out which sections were relevant, do a lot more editing and formatting, not to mention the book being longer to begin with. It was taking me too much time and effort to get stuff done.
        </p>
        <p>
             Instead I found this book. Each section is shorter and easier to format. It's also more intermediate-facing, which means it should be relevant to more people.
        </p>
        <p>
             The next two chapters are where the book starts to leave the &ldquo;beginner area&rdquo; and get into the &ldquo;intermediate area&rdquo;. This chapter is about hand- and wall-reading. Hand reading should be based on good defense-theory. Wall reading builds upon a good understanding of tile efficiency. They involve keeping track of discards over the course of a hand, instead of at specific fixed points in a hand. For some of you, mastering the basics will do more than understanding the next two chapters. Of course -- the next two chapters are useful even if you haven't mastered the basics, and I would certainly prefer you be interested in learning, rather than try to tell you what the best way to learn is.
        </p>
        <p>
             To those of you for whom the above chapter was relevant, please make note that some of this depends on the level of your opponents as well. You will start to see names of professional players, or names of tournaments, used in the examples. That's one of the ways you can tell things are starting to get higher-level. At the very least, your opponents should be playing at a basic level of competency, with a good understanding and following of basic tile efficiency and defending. You don't need to worry too much about the level of your opponents in this chapter. But it will be much more relevant in the next chapter. We'll talk about it then.
        </p>
        <p>
             If you want to review the basics, I would recommend a quick read through chapters 4 and 8 of <a href="https://dainachiba.github.io/RiichiBooks/"> Riichi Book I</a> (Daina Chiba, 2016).
