             As I have said up until now, nowadays riichi is valued more than it used to be. Especially looked highly upon is the value of being the first to declare riichi. A kanchan-wait tanyao-dora 1 hand, with which people used to try to wait for improvements, is now understood as a very effective riichi hand.
        </p>
        <p>
             The reason for this change is understanding how riichi affects your opponents, in addition to simply making your hand bigger. Even if you are somewhat less likely too win your hand, your riichi will greatly affect your opponents' ability to build their hands, which usually is a plus. Would you riichi this hand? However, note that you have already discarded <span class="tiles">o</span>, and are in furiten.

        <p>
             The answer is riichi. A 3-sided wait is plenty to wait on, and the improved value is enough for you to lose the ability to defend. The pressure exerted on your opponents due to the presence of a riichi is large, and you should aim to force your opponents to bail and win by tsumo.

             What about this hand? You've also already discarded <span class="tiles">o</span>. This is a difficult decision, but I think discarding <span class="tiles">i</span> and waiting on the kanchan <span class="tiles">y</span> is better than taking the furiten. As for why, it's better to hope to ron off of someone else's <span class="tiles">y</span> that it is to hope to tsumo <span class="tiles">o</span>. I can't explain it clearly in numbers, but in general, we understand that <strong>3-sided furiten</strong> &gt; <strong>not-furiten kanchan</strong> &gt; <strong>furiten ryanmen</strong>. However, for point situations where other people are likely to fully bail if you declare riichi, you can choose a furiten ryanmen that's easy to tsumo with.
        </p>

        <p>
             The way I've wrote it, you might think it's okay to not care about furiten and declare riichi in general, but the most important requirement is being the first one to riichi. The purpose of a riichi is to increase a hands value, and to put pressure on opponents. If someone else has already declared riichi, your riichi won't do much to stop your opponents' hands. Instead, you are likely to become the prey of the already declared riichi. An <span id="footnote-tag-1">oikake<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span> furiten riichi should be reserved only for situations where your have a hand so big you can't bail, or when you have a big hand with a very good wait.
