    <h1 class="title">Excerpts from スーパーデジタル麻雀 by 小林剛</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Excerpts from Super Digital Mahjong by Kobayashi Gō</h2>
    <p>
        This section is a translation of excerpts from the book <em>Super Digital Mahjong</em> from Kobayashi Gō of the M-League team U-NEXT Pirates. This is an intermediate-level leaning book, but it is pretty beginner-friendly too.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a foreword, I don't have a lot of experience in translation, so apologies in advance for any mistakes I make.

    <h2 class="heading"> Translator's Note</h2>
    <p>
        Different people have different playstyles, and often there is no strict right or wrong thing to do. This book presents a digital playstyle that is the opinions of one professional mahjong player. It explains why you should do certain things, but does not present a sufficient amount of arguments as to why you shouldn't do those things. As such, it is much more important that you understand the thinking and reason behind each lesson, that it is to blindly follow what this book says. I translated parts of this book because it was really helpful to me. It may not be equally helpful to everybody.

    <p>
        The following is the foreword from the book. Select chapters from the book will be translated and released on this webpage over time.

    <h2 class="heading"> Foreword. Declaration of De-Super-Digitalization</h2>
    <p>
        Nice to meet you, I am Kobayashi Go. People often use the phrase &ldquo;Super Digital&rdquo; when introducing me. The phrase also appears in the title of this book. However, I never wanted to be called &ldquo;Super Digital&rdquo;, and I opposed using the phrase in the title of this book more than anybody.
    </p>
    <p>Let's talk a little bit about the word &ldquo;digital&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>
        In my memory, the word &ldquo;digital&rdquo; first appeared in the world of mahjong around 1990, in the manga &ldquo;Shobushi no Joken&rdquo; (Doi Yasuaki; Minegishi Nobuaki). Before that, mahjong tactics consisted primarily of understanding the relationship between rounds, cause and effect, the flow of luck, etc. Each round was thought to be connected to each other. To make an analogy, it was like the ticking of an analog clock.
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, there was the understanding that the events in each round of mahjong are random events independent of previous and following rounds, like a digital clock, showing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 instead of a rotating clock hand. This understanding, where the events of the next hand of mahjong cannot be predicted by the events of the previous hand, is called &ldquo;digital&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ever since I learned to play mahjong, I've understood it as a game of independent probabilities, absent of any unscientific causes-and-effects. Unfortunately, not many people agreed with me twenty years ago. Traditional mahjong players thought of my playstyle as unorthodox and heretical. Of course it was normal to have people criticizing a new theory of mahjong. But they didn't just disagree with us, they also twisted our own words:
    </p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Mahjong tiles are arranged randomly&rdquo; &rarr; &ldquo;There is no flow of luck&rdquo; &rarr; &ldquo;Only use clearly understood theories&rdquo; &rarr; &ldquo;Only think about clearly visible tiles and points&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
        From this misunderstanding, people have unfairly criticized us for saying that mahjong is a shallow game, even though that is not what we mean. The meaning of the word &ldquo;digital&rdquo; has become ambiguous over time.
    </p>
    <p>
        I do not want to use the word &ldquo;digital&rdquo; if it's meaning is no longer clear. Although the word &ldquo;digital&rdquo; appears many times in this book, I do not mean to use such an ambiguous word. I just want my position on mahjong to be clear: I will not talk about unscientific, occult theories.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nevertheless, the publishers asked me to publish a book called &ldquo;Super Digital Mahjong&rdquo;. Although I'm very thankful, I didn't like putting a word like &ldquo;digital&rdquo; next to my name. Not to mention &ldquo;super&rdquo;, whatever that means.... I was a bit confused myself as to what to do, and at times wanted to stop the publication of this book. But, if a phrase like &ldquo;super digital&rdquo; can get more people interested in this book, and understand what I think when playing mahjong, perhaps that is also for the best. After rethinking about it this way I decided to have this book published after all.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for what this book actually is, I can only ask you to read and decide for yourself. Although occult concepts like &ldquo;flow&rdquo; and &ldquo;luck&rdquo; won't appear in this book, that doesn't mean the book will be about just numbers and statistics and such things that you can see. As much as I can, I have presented theories that will definitely help you and make you win more. I have also included some random thoughts of mine on the side, which hopefully can entertain you throughout the book.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the first, and perhaps will be the last book from me that uses the claim &ldquo;digital&rdquo;.
