             This is one of my hands from a real game. I had 2 dora in my starting hand. On turn 3, I drew 7p, and chiitoitsu is now the obvious route. What should we discard here?
        </p>
        <p>
             10 years ago, I probably would have discarded <span class="tiles">r</span> or <span class="tiles">h</span>. Discarding dangerous middle tiles first, holding on to terminals and honors.
        </p>
        <p>
             That said, I discarded the round wind <span class="tiles">2</span>. Then on the next turn, I didn't discard the <span class="tiles">n</span> I drew, and instead discarded <span class="tiles">.</span>. This is to keep <span class="tiles">5</span> and <span class="tiles">7</span>, my likely waits, while making a normal discard pile, so that other people can't read that I have a chiitoitsu hand. The trick is to make pairs with middle tiles as much as you can, and make terminals and honors appear in your discard pile.
        </p>
        <p>
             I drew <span class="tiles">r</span> on turn 5 just as planned, and later drew <span class="tiles">7</span>, waiting on the 1-discarded <span class="tiles">5</span>. My discard pile was <span class="tiles">ik2.nhc</span>. Then <span id="footnote-tag-1">
                peicha<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a>
            </span> entered tenpai, discarded <span class="tiles">5</span>, and dealt in to my hand for 9600 points.
        </p>
        <p>
             Lets think instead about if my discard pile was <span class="tiles">ikrnh</span>, and then discarded <span class="tiles">2</span> as I entered tenpai. People would have been paying attention to my hand as atypical, and discarding shonpai <span class="tiles">2</span> would have felt like tenpai. People would be able to read that I have a chiitoitsu hand, and even a 1-cut <span class="tiles">5</span> would have become hard to come out. The 3rd-turn <span class="tiles">2</span> discard is to prevent such an outcome.
        </p>

        <p>
             That said, you need to be very careful playing like this. If you're not careful, you'll end up with a hand full of dangerous middle tiles. You have to carefully balance sakigiri, awaseuchi<span id="footnote-tag-2">
                <a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-2" title="jump to footnote 2">[2]</a>
            </span>, and keeping safe tiles, a very difficult thing to do.

                  For the flow of the paragraph, I left the terms untranslated here. Sakigiri (&ldquo;discarding-first&rdquo;) refers to discarding dangerous tiles early before they become dangerous. <a href="https://natsuai.com/mahjong/digital/chapter-1-1/"> Chapter 1.1</a> is an example of sakigiri. Awaseuchi (&ldquo;discard-matching&rdquo;) refers to discarding a tile that someone else just discarded, as it is confirmed safe for the time being.
