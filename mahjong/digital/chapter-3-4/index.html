        <p>
             In this section, we'll talk specifically about the act of passing up the first yakuhai drop and calling the second<span id="footnote-tag-2"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-2" title="jump to footnote 2">[2]</a></span>. There are usually two reasons to do this:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Your hand is bad, and far away from winning. If possible, you would like to not open up your hand (and make it harder to defend).
            </li>
            <li>Your hand is good, and you want to stay closed if possible to increase the hand's value.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">

                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">

        </ol>
        <p>
             With hand <strong>A</strong>, many people perhaps would be reluctant to call the first <span class="tiles">5</span> because the shape is bad (reason 1). I, too, would not recommend calling <span class="tiles">5</span> and discarding <span class="tiles">4</span>, which would result in hand <strong>B</strong>. But what about hand <strong>C</strong>, where you discard <span class="tiles">s</span>? It's closer to winning, safer than <strong>B</strong> by keeping the <span class="tiles">4</span>, and in general a pretty balanced hand.
        </p>
        <p>
             People who don't call the first <span class="tiles">5</span> are probably hoping to draw <span class="tiles">5</span> to have hand <strong>D</strong>. But please compare hands <strong>A</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, and <strong>D</strong> in terms of expected value, win probability, and safeness. Compared to hand <strong>D</strong>, <strong>C</strong> is lower in expected value and safeness. But compared to hand <strong>A</strong>, the probability of winning is much higher, which means the probability of an opponent winning is lowered. To idealize the hand <strong>D</strong> too much to the point of rejecting the next best thing <strong>C</strong> can only be characterized as naivety from the player.
        </p>
        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">eroobbnsdf455</span></div><div class="dora">
                            <div class="ruby ruby-center"><span class="tiles">s</span><div class="rt">Dora</div></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             Reason 2 probably refers to a hand like <strong>E</strong>. However, if you decide to stay closed with this hand, you must be prepared for your hand to be slower compared to if you had called. But if the second <span class="tiles">5</span> comes out, you'll still end up calling, so I don't think it's worth it. So, not calling the first tile with hand <strong>E</strong> is, the same as doing so with hand <strong>A</strong>, naive.
        </p>
        <p>
             Passing up the first tile and calling the second is a technique with a long history. But usually it ends up being used like this to satisfy the player's childish willfulness, not as an effective tactic. Especially nowadays, people are more effective with calling, and hands are often decided before &ldquo;the second tile&rdquo; comes out, making this tactic even less effective.

                  The original japanese title is &ldquo;「2鳴き」はワガママ&rdquo;, I'm unable to translate the term &ldquo;ワガママ&rdquo; properly, so I'm mentioning the original title here, if it provides any additional context to you.

                 There is a technical term for this: ninaki (2鳴き, lit. &ldquo;2-calling&rdquo;). Not limited only to yakuhai, the term refers to passing up the first tile with the intention of calling the second tile; or, conversely, calling the second tile having passed up the first tile. Since this is an uncommon term, it will stay in this footnote.
