             Following up on the previous section, sometimes you will have a ryanmen-kanchan shape, and intentionally not keep it.
        </p>
        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">yyzcvbbnasdfgg</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">werzcvbbnnaahj</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             Hand <strong>A</strong>: choose between <span class="tiles">z</span> and <span class="tiles">g</span> to discard. Like previous sections hand <strong>D</strong>, discarding <span class="tiles">g</span> guarantees pinfu, but is that really the right thing to do here? Drawing <span class="tiles">y</span> or <span class="tiles">g</span> first gives you tanyao. Since tanyao has a higher value than pinfu, as well as allowing you to open your hand, discarding <span class="tiles">z</span> is better here. Don't discard <span class="tiles">g</span> just because &ldquo;It's ryanmen-kanchan!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
             Discarding <span class="tiles">n</span> from hand <strong>B</strong> guarantees pinfu. Regardless of what you draw you can riichi and have a 2000-point hand. What if you discarded <span class="tiles">z</span>? You will lose the 2000-point hand from the <span class="tiles">x</span> draw, and gain the 1300-point hand from the <span class="tiles">n</span> and <span class="tiles">a</span> draw. If it was only that, pinfu would be better. But also, drawing <span class="tiles">v</span> would guarantee iipeikou, making your hand worth 3900 points. Although there are only three more <span class="tiles">v</span>, the 1900-point increase in value is quite significant. If you're planning to riichi your hand, discarding <span class="tiles">z</span> is better.
        </p>
        <p>
             However, if you were not planning to riichi, for example, if you're in first place and want to progress the round with a damaten hand, then it is better to guarantee pinfu and discard <span class="tiles">n</span>. Often times hands should be handled differently in different situations.
        </p>
        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">dfgwwrtybngh4</span></div><div class="dora">
                            <div class="ruby ruby-center"><span class="tiles">a</span><div class="rt">Draw</div></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             Now let's look at hand <strong>C</strong>. This hand is 1-shanten for tanyao-pinfu-sanshoku. You want <span class="tiles">vm</span> and <span class="tiles">fj</span>, and you're holding on to <span class="tiles">4</span> as a safe tile. Some people wouldn't think twice about discarding <span class="tiles">a</span>, but of course the right discard is <span class="tiles">4</span>. It would be more obvious if you put the souzu tiles together: <span class="tiles">adfggh</span>. Keeping <span class="tiles">a</span> gives you the <span class="tiles">s</span> draw. Many people end up only thinking about tanyao-pinfu-sanshoku, and arrange their hands the same way as example <strong>C</strong>, causing them to miss this shape. Be careful not to do this.

             That said, the term &ldquo;ryanmen-kanchan&rdquo; is pretty difficult to understand. Can someone figure out a better name for it...?
