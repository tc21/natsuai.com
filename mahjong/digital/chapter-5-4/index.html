             Urasuji (裏スジ, lit. &ldquo;inside suji&rdquo;) is a concept with a long history, but it turns out few people properly understand it. For example, if you have <span class="tiles">sfg</span>, you will discard <span class="tiles">s</span> to wait on <span class="tiles">dh</span>. This kind of ryanmen wait adjacent to a discarded tile is called urasuji. In the previous example, the urasuji of <span class="tiles">s</span> is <span class="tiles">dh</span>. In this section, I'd like to talk about how to use the concept of urasuji.
        </p>
        <p>
             In the early turns, we discard single, unconnected tiles, starting from the least useful. In general, most people discard in the order of honor tiles &rarr; 1 and 9 &rarr; 2 and 8 &rarr; 3 through 7. The following is a discard pile of someone who declared riichi. How should you think about this riichi? All tiles, other than <span class="tiles">1</span> and <span class="tiles">q</span> are tedashi.
        </p>
        <div class="hand-container">
            <div class="hand compact discards">
                <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">4ab5wi1q<span class="sideways">H</span></span></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
             The first tile that catches the eye is the riichi declaration tile <span class="tiles">h</span>. But there is a tile that I want you to pay more attention to in this discard pile. That is the third-turn discard <span class="tiles">b</span>. Why would they discard this middle-of-the-pack number tile this early? If <span class="tiles">b</span> was just an ordinary single tile, <span class="tiles">5</span> and <span class="tiles">w</span> should have been discarded before it. Even if they had a <span class="tiles">bbn</span> shape, discarding <span class="tiles">b</span> there for the ryanmen shape is rare. Usually you would hold on to it. So they have a shape that doesn't lose much tile efficiency by discarding <span class="tiles">b</span>. In other words, they likely had <span class="tiles">xcb</span> or <span class="tiles">bm,</span>. With regards to this riichi, the urasuji of <span class="tiles">b</span>, that is <span class="tiles">zv</span> and <span class="tiles">n.</span>, are particularly dangerous. Like this, if someone discards an easy-to-use 3 through 7 tile early, its urasuji becomes dangerous. On the other hand, waits that happen across that discard become less dangerous. Think about this discard pile:
        </p>
        <div class="hand-container">
            <div class="hand compact discards">
                <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">4l5wi1q<span class="sideways">B</span></span></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
             Unlike the first example, this time the <span class="tiles">b</span> looks to be a tile that could have been useful right up until the riichi. Thus it's unlikely to have been discarded from a <span class="tiles">xcb</span> or <span class="tiles">bm,</span> shape. If (for example) they're waiting on <span class="tiles">zv</span>, it would likely be because they improved a <span class="tiles">cb</span> kanchan shape by drawing <span class="tiles">x</span>, but those cases are uncommon. Today, we value first riichi, and most people would immediately declare riichi, even with a kanchan shape. Thus, when paying attention to a <span class="tiles">b</span> riichi declaration tile, you should be careful about its matagi-suji (跨ぎスジ, lit. &ldquo;across-suji&rdquo;). That is, since shapes like <span class="tiles">vbb</span> and <span class="tiles">bbn</span> are common, <span class="tiles">cn</span> and <span class="tiles">vm</span> are dangerous.

             (Translator's note: urasuji and matagi-suji have been part of the most popular yet controversial theories/pseudotheories in mahjong. They are difficult to understand, and easy to misuse. Kobayashi talks about this in the next section, so please read on if you've read this section. Also, if you want a better understanding of these concepts, mahjonggem.com (Jemma Sakamoto) has articles on <a href="https://www.mahjonggem.com/blog/2019/6/10/ura-suji"> urasuji</a>, <a href="https://www.mahjonggem.com/blog/2019/6/12/matagi-suji"> matagi-suji</a>, and why <a href="https://www.mahjonggem.com/blog/2019/6/11/ura-suji-caveat"> you shouldn't trust urasuji</a>.)
