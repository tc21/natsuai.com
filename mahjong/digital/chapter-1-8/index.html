             What would you discard from this hand? Don't think too hard about it. Which tile was your first instinct?

            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact"><div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">zxcvvb</span></div></div>
                </div>

            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact"><div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">zxxcvb</span></div></div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact"><div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">xxcvvb</span></div></div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             The only suit you can discard from is pinzu. Think about what the pinzu shape is. Most people's first instinct is to see this as <span class="tiles">zxc</span> + <span class="tiles">vvb</span>, and discard <span class="tiles">x</span>. The resulting shape is <strong>A</strong>. The <span class="tiles">cn</span>-ryanmen, and <span class="tiles">v4</span> can get you to tenpai. This is a &ldquo;perfect 1-shanten&rdquo; shape. Some people might want to secure the <span class="tiles">vb</span>-ryanmen first, discarding <span class="tiles">v</span>. The resulting shape is <strong>B</strong>. <span class="tiles">x</span> also gets you tenpai in this shape.
        </p>
        <p>
             Another potential discard is <span class="tiles">z</span>. The resulting shape is <strong>C</strong>. You can use <span class="tiles">cn</span> and <span class="tiles">x</span>, just like <strong>B</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
             In other words, <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>C</strong> have the same efficiency. Clearly, <strong>C</strong> is the best shape here as it keeps the iipeikou potential, and <span class="tiles">z</span> is the best discard.
        </p>
        <p>
             Although <span class="tiles">z</span> is the best discard here, it seems that many people don't even realize that <span class="tiles">z</span> is an option. I asked many people around me, and most of them saw the hand as <span class="tiles">zxc</span> + <span class="tiles">vvb</span>, and are not familiar with the shape in <strong>C</strong>. Many of them are slow to understand similar shapes too, such as <span class="tiles">rrtyyu</span> or <span class="tiles">ghhjkk</span>.
        </p>
        <ol class="example-list" style="counter-reset: list-counter 3;">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact"><div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">zxcvvbb</span></div></div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             If you can quickly understand and choose between the shapes <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, and <strong>C</strong>, you will be able to have more choices when you play mahjong. For example, if your were to choose two tiles to discard from <strong>D</strong>, of course if you were thinking about tanyao-pinfu-iipeikou you would discard <span class="tiles">zx</span>. But when thinking about tile safety or ease of calling tiles, <span class="tiles">vb</span>, <span class="tiles">zb</span>, or <span class="tiles">bz</span> are also possible orders of discarding tiles.
        </p>
        <p>
             Improve your familiarity with different shapes. Then you will be able to make the best decision depending on the situation you're in.
