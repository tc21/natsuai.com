             Often you encounter a tsumogiri riichi, but they can be difficult to understand. Let's think about it a little.

             The most often reason to tsumogiri riichi is when someone wanted to wait for a bigger hand or a better wait, but the improvement never came, and it's getting late. For example, hands <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>. For hands like <strong>C</strong> and <strong>D</strong>, you are much more likely to win before you draw your improvement, so most of the times people would declare riichi immediately. Regardless of what would happen 30 years ago, today, when the first riichi is valued, and tile efficiency is better in general, rarely would people wait for an improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
             Are there cases when someone would tsumogiri riichi when they have a hand that's big and has a good wait, like <strong>E</strong>? People wanting to limit others' hands and tsumo would have declared riichi immediately, while people hoping to win off of others would stay damaten until the very end. In other words, we can say that a tsumogiri riichi would not be a hand like this.
        </p>
        <p>
             And thus, the reaction to a tsumogiri riichi, is to expect your opponent to have a bad wait, and don't have a good ryanmen wait, or an honor tile wait, and discard non-suji 1/9 tiles. Even if you deal it, it would probably not be a very big hand.
        </p>
        <p>
             However, in the south round, against an opponent with not a lot of points, this technique becomes unreliable. It's possible that they held on to a hand like <strong>C</strong>, waiting for an improvement, but in the end they had to declare riichi as-is. Make sure to react to point- and round-situations.
        </p>

        <p>
             By the way, a popular way of playing recently has been &ldquo;there's not much difference between riichi and damaten here, so I'll intentionally tsumogiri riichi to confuse my opponents&rdquo;. An example would be Suzuki Taro's<span id="footnote-tag-1"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span> tsumogiri riichi. You just have no idea what he has. Sometimes he'll wait a turn before declaring riichi with a pinfu-dora 1 hand, sometimes he'll even pass up a ron just to tsumogiri riichi. Of course this playstyle is risky, but you'd hate to be his opponent.
        </p>
        <p>
             When playing against someone like that, you should avoid reading too much into their hands. &ldquo;They would have immediately declared riichi&rdquo; stops being useful information. So, you should probably not think too much about it, and treat is as just a normal riichi.
