             I hear this constantly in mahjong. Let's talk a bit about this. Mahjong is a game where you draw from randomly shuffled tiles, and thus it is a constant stream of random events, one after another. If every time something happens, you lose your composure, then you will be unable to make the correct decisions. It's important to have a strong mentality that isn't affected by anything that happens. You often hear about having a &ldquo;strong mentality&rdquo;, but there are few games in which a strong mentality is as important as mahjong.

             What should you discard from this hand? There isn't a great difference between <span class="tiles">qw</span> and <span class="tiles">,.</span>. You just have to discard one of them, whether it's the color you like less, or because it's closer to your dominant hand. Perhaps you decided to discard <span class="tiles">qw</span>, and then a couple of turns later you draw <span class="tiles">e</span>!
        </p>
        <p>
             &ldquo;Ahh, I failed!&rdquo; &ldquo;How am I so bad?&rdquo; &ldquo;This wasn't the plan!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
             There is no need to grief about anything. You've already decided <span class="tiles">e</span> was useless when you discarded <span class="tiles">qw</span>, so just discard <span class="tiles">e</span>. It's not an unexpected development, nor is it a failure. Discarding <span class="tiles">e</span> was exactly your plan.
        </p>
        <p> How about this hand?</p>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="hand-container">
                <div class="hand compact">
                    <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">tyxvn..ashjk57</span></div><div class="dora">
                        <div class="ruby ruby-center"><span class="tiles">.</span><div class="rt">Dora</div></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
             With 2 dora, you want to quickly find a yaku, or make a set. You can't choose anything other than <span class="tiles">5</span> and <span class="tiles">7</span>, but without any information, let's just discard <span class="tiles">5</span>. And the next turn you draw <span class="tiles">5</span>!
        </p>
        <p>
             &ldquo;Ahh! I failed!&rdquo; &ldquo;My intuition isn't working! Nothing's going to work out today!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
             Don't think like that. Of course the discard was one according to plan, but is this <span class="tiles">5</span> really such a bad draw? There are 34 different mahjong tiles. In this shape, there about 10 that are useful, and more than 20 that are useless. Certainly <span class="tiles">5</span> is part of those useless tiles, but it's the safest among them, and gives away the least amount of information. You could probably call it &ldquo;the best useless tile&rdquo;. Think of it as being much better than drawing and discarding some new tile, like <span class="tiles">i</span> or <span class="tiles">z</span>.
