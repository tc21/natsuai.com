             Reading your opponent's hand isn't an easy task. One of the most important tiles is the one they play to get into tenpai, such as their riichi declaration tile. This is usually a tile that's useful to their hand up until the moment they declared riichi. Often times, the tile is related to their waits, or provide important information about the direction of their hand. In this section, we'll talk about a case that provides very useful information: when two tiles of the same suit are discarded separately.

        <p>
             First, let's look at the discard pile <strong>A</strong>. After discarding <span class="tiles">x</span>, they first discarded the safer <span class="tiles">4</span>, and then declared riichi with <span class="tiles">v</span>. What this means is that they didn't need <span class="tiles">x</span>, but <span class="tiles">v</span> was useful until the very end. First, we can consider the following shapes: <span class="tiles">vvb</span>, <span class="tiles">vbb</span>, and <span class="tiles">vnn</span>. In these cases the most likely wait is <span class="tiles">cn</span>, followed by a shanpon of <span class="tiles">n</span> and something else. If they had <span class="tiles">vbb</span>, that means they are using <span class="tiles">b</span> as their head, and their wait is somewhere else<span id="footnote-tag-1"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span>. Additionally, if they had <span class="tiles">vnm</span> they would probably discard <span class="tiles">v</span> before <span class="tiles">4</span>, so the likelihood of a <span class="tiles">b,</span> wait is much lower than a <span class="tiles">cn</span> wait.
        </p>
        <p>
             <strong>B</strong> is just <strong>A</strong> with the discard order reversed, but it gives us vastly different information. In <strong>A</strong>, the most likely wait was <span class="tiles">cn</span>. In <strong>B</strong>, that would mean discarding <span class="tiles">v</span> first from <span class="tiles">xvvb</span> and throwing away the possibility of forming a <span class="tiles">v</span> triplet, a very unnatural move. In other words, a <span class="tiles">cn</span> ryanmen wait is unlikely. Then, if we think about shapes where <span class="tiles">v</span> is useless, but <span class="tiles">x</span> is be useful, it would be <span class="tiles">zzx</span>. In other words, this hand is likely to be a shanpon wait between <span class="tiles">z</span> and something else. Although it's suji, we should not easily discard <span class="tiles">z</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
             <strong>C</strong> is a shape where someone broke apart a ryanmen. But still they were able to keep <span class="tiles">v</span> in their hand until the very end. If they had <span class="tiles">vnm</span>, they would have probably discarded <span class="tiles">v</span> before <span class="tiles">4</span>, so only one shape is thinkable: <span class="tiles">cvv</span>. In other words, three turns ago they had <span class="tiles">ccvv</span>, and not wanting to draw <span class="tiles">xb</span> twice, they discarded one each of <span class="tiles">c</span> and <span class="tiles">v</span>. Thus <span class="tiles">xb</span> is quite dangerous.
        </p>
        <p>
             Pay attention when someone discards two (connected) tiles of the same suit, as it is a hint to the shape of their hand.

                 Translator's note: Why can't they be waiting shanpon on the <span class="tiles">b</span>? Generally speaking, if they had another pair elsewhere, they would have discarded <span class="tiles">b</span> waiting on the <span class="tiles">cn</span> ryanmen, instead of shanpon.
