             With the exception of chiitoitsu and kokushi-musou, all mahjong hands have a shape of &ldquo;4 sets and 1 pair&rdquo;. This &ldquo;4 sets and 1 pair&rdquo; combined makes 5 blocks. It is very important to think of mahjong as making 5 blocks.

                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">qwyuxcm..fgg77</span></div><div class="dora">

        <p>
             Many people might look at the hand above and want to play <span class="tiles">g</span> to secure a two-sided shape, but my recommendation here is to discard <span class="tiles">qw</span>. At a glance it might seem like a loss in tile efficiency, it's important to consider the progression of the hand later on. Let's consider what would happen if you discarded <span class="tiles">g</span>, and then drew a ryanmen shape, or the <span class="tiles">7</span> set.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">qwyuzxcm..fg77</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">qwyuxcm..fg777</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
             Either way, it looks like you will end up discarding <span class="tiles">qw</span>. Even if instead of <span class="tiles">g</span> you discarded <span class="tiles">m</span> the situation would be the same. The only situation where you won't discard <span class="tiles">qw</span> would be if you drew <span class="tiles">e</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
             We can also look at it from another perspective. After discarding <span class="tiles">g</span>, you would be <span id="footnote-tag-1">
                tsumogiri-ing<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a>
            </span> until you complete your next set. Tiles that can form a pair like <span class="tiles">yuxc</span>, or safe tiles like <span class="tiles">3</span>, would all have to be discarded. If we had discarded <span class="tiles">qw</span> instead, we would lose the <span class="tiles">e</span> draw, but gain a &ldquo;free spot&rdquo; in our hand for any tile we want. This is especially helpful if we wanted to keep a safe tile, or the dora <span class="tiles">6</span>. In short, discarding 5s makes your hand appear more efficient, but actually constrains your hand, making it too inflexible. Discarding <span class="tiles">qw</span> is less efficient for now, but gives you the flexibility to handle whatever tile that happens to come your way.
        </p>
        <p>
             Why is such a thing happening? If you look at the hand at the very beginning, you'll see that the hand has 6 sets of tiles that could potentially become a complete set (i.e. 6 &ldquo;blocks&rdquo;): <span class="tiles">qw</span>, <span class="tiles">yu</span>, <span class="tiles">xc</span>, <span class="tiles">m..</span>, <span class="tiles">fgg</span>, <span class="tiles">77</span>. It is impossible to utilize all 6 blocks in your hand. You must give up one one of them in order to win. In most cases, you will end up giving up the <span class="tiles">qw</span> block. In such a situation, you should give up on the weaker block that you would most likely end up giving up anyway, and hold on to the 5 stronger blocks in your hand.
