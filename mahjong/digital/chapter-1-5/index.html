        <p> In this section we'll introduce a basic mahjong shape.</p>
        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">werzcvbbnddhj4</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">qwezcvbbnsdkk4</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             First let's look and hand <strong>A</strong>. If you discard <span class="tiles">4</span>, what tiles can you draw that will put you into tenpai? <span class="tiles">vm</span> and <span class="tiles">gk</span> are very obvious. But if you treat the pinzu shape as <span class="tiles">zcb</span> + <span class="tiles">vbn</span>, you can see that <span class="tiles">x</span> is also a tenpai draw. You want to not miss this, and play <span class="tiles">4</span> in this situation. If you intend to keep <span class="tiles">4</span> as a safe tile, understand that you are sacrificing the speed of your hand by losing the <span class="tiles">x</span> draw.
        </p>
        <p>
             This kind of shape is called &ldquo;ryanmen-kanchan&rdquo;. This shape occurs frequently in mahjong, and people often miss it. Especially when you have a hand like <strong>A</strong>, you might only see the tanyao and accidentally think that <span class="tiles">z</span> is useless. In a shape like hand <strong>B</strong> where you can see a sanshoku, most people probably wouldn't be discarding <span class="tiles">z</span>.
        </p>
        <p> Let's look at some more hands.</p>
        <ol class="example-list" style="counter-reset: list-counter 2;">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">ertcvvbn,,dfkk</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">yuizcvbbnaahhj</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             Some people would keep the complicated pinzu shape in hand <strong>C</strong>. But look closely. If you discard <span class="tiles">,</span>, what you have left is <span class="tiles">cvvbn,</span>. You will be able to use <span class="tiles">xbm</span> with this shape. By recognizing this shape, you'll realize the correct discard isn't <span class="tiles">k</span>, but <span class="tiles">,</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
             In hand <strong>D</strong>, discarding <span class="tiles">z</span> would make you lose the <span class="tiles">x</span> draw, but in return you would be able to keep the <span class="tiles">a</span> and <span class="tiles">h</span> draws. Discarding <span class="tiles">h</span> would give you the opposite, allowing you to use <span class="tiles">x</span>. Either option gives you 4 tiles to draw. Drawing <span class="tiles">x</span> allows you to have pinfu, so dropping <span class="tiles">h</span> is the correct response here.
        </p>
        <p>
             Ryanmen-kanchan is a very important shape. Make sure you don't accidently miss it when playing mahjong.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="tiles">
                    wrtyyu<span class="tile-separator"></span><span class="tile-separator"></span>fgghjl
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="tiles">
                    xccvbm<span class="tile-separator"></span><span class="tile-separator"></span>qwwery
                </span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
             Be able to recognize this shape with a variety of numbers and suits. The last example isn't a ryanmen, but you should understand it as the same shape.
