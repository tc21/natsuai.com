        <p>
             Up until now I've talked about how to think with 5 blocks. Thinking with 5 blocks means with a hand like <strong>A</strong>, which 6 useful shapes, to cut <span class="tiles">qw</span>, the weakest one. You are somewhat deciding on the path forward for your hand, and taking the shortest path towards the hand you envision. I call this a &ldquo;decision play&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
             What about <strong>B</strong>? You can be decisive and discard <span class="tiles">qw</span> or <span class="tiles">io</span>, but unless there is a big difference in the board situation, locking into a particular penchan shape early on feels a little insecure. Why not put off making a choice for now, and discard <span class="tiles">s</span> to lock into the ryanmen shape. Alternatively, if there are few <span class="tiles">,</span> remaining, <span class="tiles">m</span> is also a good discard.
        </p>
        <p>
             Like this, instead of deciding on the path you'll take, postponing the decision until later while keeping your shanten the same, is what I call a &ldquo;deferral play&rdquo;. You should keep this in your repertoire of tactics. While it might look like a half-baked approach, it's often useful in the early stages of a hand.
        </p>
        <p>
             <strong>C</strong> is a shape that appears often. Discarding <span class="tiles">7</span> to allow for drawing <span class="tiles">c</span> or <span class="tiles">l</span> gets you to tenpai the fastest, but if you take into account the risk of <span class="tiles">7</span> getting called, or drawing the dora yourself, discarding <span class="tiles">c</span> and locking into the ryanmen shape for now looks better.
        </p>

        <p>
             <strong>D</strong> is like <strong>C</strong>, but the shapes of souzu isn't great. If you say &ldquo;I'll go for it if I draw into pinfu&rdquo; and discard <span class="tiles">f</span>, or &ldquo;I'll attack with a <span class="tiles">fl</span> shanpon wait&rdquo; and discard <span class="tiles">s</span>, that would be a &ldquo;deferral play&rdquo;. If you go all out and discard <span class="tiles">7</span>, or if you say &ldquo;I'll never discard the dora&rdquo; and discard <span class="tiles">l</span>, that would be a &ldquo;decision play&rdquo;<span id="footnote-tag-1"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
             My recommendation is to discard <span class="tiles">s</span> or <span class="tiles">f</span>. The only times to discard dora from an insecure shape like this, is when it is very early on in a hand, or fighting for placement in all last. That said deciding to not discard dora and break up a 1-shanten hand by discarding <span class="tiles">l</span> is too negative of an approach. In usual circumstances, just think about what shapes are work pushing the dora, and keep 1-shanten by cutting one of <span class="tiles">s</span> or <span class="tiles">f</span>.
