             Totsugeki Tohoku (<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%A8%E3%81%A4%E3%81%92%E3%81%8D%E6%9D%B1%E5%8C%97">Japanese Wikipedia</a>) was the person to coin the term &ldquo;sensei riichi&rdquo; (先制リーチ, lit. &ldquo;first-to-riichi&rdquo;) and preach its effectiveness. Over the last decade, he has succeeded in making the concept commonplace.
        </p>
        <p>
             The greatest merit of riichi is limiting your opponents' ability to play freely. Hands that, in the past, was thought better kept in damaten to get a better wait, are now understood to be more beneficial to declare riichi, due to riichi's ability to limit your opponents. When the riichi comes, even the most aggressive of opponents would bu unable to freely progress their hand without having their tile order affected.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="hand-container">
                <div class="hand compact">
                    <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">weryyyzxcnnhk</span></div><div class="dora">
                        <div class="ruby ruby-center"><span class="tiles">e</span><div class="rt">Dora</div></div>
                    </div>

        </div>
        <p>
             Consider this yakunashi-dora 1 kanchan tenpai. Some of you may not want to riichi with this bad-shape 2600-point hand, but declaring riichi with this hand is more advantageous. Although you won't necessarily win this hand, considering the value of the hand with the possibility of ippatsu and uradora, the damage you do to your opponents' hands, and ryuukyoku tenpai payments, the expected value of the hand is higher if you declare riichi.
        </p>
        <p>
             However, if you don't have dora, the expected gain is just too low, and it's tricky to say whether you should riichi or not. In that case you should only riichi if you have a ryanmen wait, or an otherwise reasonably good wait.
        </p>
        <p>
             Additionally, it is beneficial to riichi a hand like this one as long as we are in the early turns:
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="hand-container">
                <div class="hand compact">
                    <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">eeyuixcvnm,df</span></div><div class="dora">
                        <div class="ruby ruby-center"><span class="tiles">e</span><div class="rt">Dora</div></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
             Tanyao-pinfu-dora 2, this is a mangan even when damaten. In the past, it was said that we should win without other people on guard against us. But if opponents want to attack, they will still play our winning tiles. I also think it is beneficial to limit our opponents' hands and aim to tsumo.
        </p>
        <p>
             The common theme of these hands is &ldquo;being the first to tenpai in an early turn&rdquo;. Even with the first hand shown, when an opponent looks like they have a large hand with their calling or riichi, it's reasonable to stay damaten or break up your hand. With the second hand, by mid-game it would be better to damaten, to prioritize winning off of your opponents over drawing the winning tile yourself.
