             Karagiri is the act of discarding a tile from your hand that is the same tile that you drew. For example, you have <span class="tiles">rty</span> in your hand, and you drew <span class="tiles">r</span>. Instead of tsumogiri, to discard the <span class="tiles">r</span> in your hand is called karagiri. It might not look like a meaningful action, but it's a type of camouflaging, and can sometimes be quite effective.
        </p>
        <p>
             To begin with, how should you think about a tile discarded from someone's hand? You don't know much about the unwanted tiles discarded at the start of a round, but by the middle of the round, a tile discarded should be related to the shape of the hand. For example, if someone discards <span class="tiles">r</span>, you can image they had a shape involving tiles close to <span class="tiles">r</span>. Something like <span class="tiles">rrt</span> or <span class="tiles">ryy</span>. Like this, karagiri usually reveals information about you hand to yoru opponents, and is something you generally shouldn't do. What are the situations where you should tsumogiri, and what are the situations where karagiri is better?

        <p> Imagine your hand is <strong>A</strong>, and your discards is <strong>B</strong>.</p>
        <p>
             You just called <span class="tiles">k</span> and discarded <span class="tiles">v</span>. If people think you are tenpai, then the tiles around your last discard <span class="tiles">v</span> are the most dangerous, and <span class="tiles">xb</span> and <span class="tiles">cn</span> won't be easily discarded. What happens if you draw <span class="tiles">e</span>? If people are wary of discarding pinzu, then you should karagiri. By discarding <span class="tiles">e</span> from your hand, people would be cautious of tiles around <span class="tiles">e</span>, and pinzu tiles become easier to come out.
        </p>
        <p> Now imagine your hand is <strong>A</strong>, and your discards is <strong>C</strong>.</p>
        <p>
             You just called <span class="tiles">k</span> and discarded <span class="tiles">u</span>, and now you draw <span class="tiles">v</span>. You should tsumogiri. Right now your last tedashi was <span class="tiles">u</span>, and people worry about discarding manzu. There is no need to purposefully discard <span class="tiles">v</span> from your hand and make pinzu tiles look dangerous.
        </p>
        <p>
             Tsumogiri tiles close to your wait, karagiri tiles that are far away. You should remember this theory.
