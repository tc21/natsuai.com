             This section is also about big point differences, this time about when you're in last place.
        </p>
        <p>
             First, when you have a 10000 to 25000-point difference. It's difficult to get out of last with just one hand, so you have to think about how many hands you have left, and how many more points you have to make up, and you should aim to be able to come back with a mangan tsumo in all-last.

        <p>
             Please look at this hand. It's South 3, and you need to make up 14200 points to get to third. The first <span class="tiles">7</span> comes out. Calling gives you a <span class="tiles">qru</span> wait, one that you're very likely to win. However, winning 1000 points here changes nothing regarding your score situation, and advances the game into all-last. A 13200-point difference between you and the dealer requires a haneman tsumo or a mangan direct, a very difficult task. What if you didn't call, and advanced your hand closed? You might make riichi+iipeikou, or chiitoitsu. Either way you can make up 2600-3200 points, putting you in range for a mangan tsumo in all-last. Additionally, your opponent being ryuukyoku at noten makes the same point difference.
        </p>
        <p>
             Considering all that, you have to pass this call. Since winning 1000 points is meaningless, you should focus on coming-back in two hands, and try to riichi this hand. Getting a higher placement is equivalent to 20000 extra points (depending on ruleset; here Saikyosen rules (10/30 uma) are used), so there's value in going for it even if it's difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
             However, if you had the same hand, in South 3<span id="footnote-tag-1"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span>, and were firmly last (e.g. E 34000, S 35000, You 3400, N 27600), then it's different. Since you're basically confirmed as last, you should call the <span class="tiles">7</span> for 1000 points, to try and gain even just a few points.
        </p>
        <p>
             Although you might be reluctant to win 1000 points when you have a huge deficit, remember that mahjong is about both placement and points. If your placement can't change, then don't be ashamed to play normally for the maximum amount of points.
        </p>

                 Kobayashi says to call from South 3, perhaps because two consecutive tsumo mangan hands is still not enough to put you into third. I don't know how to judge this decision, but I left this footnote here to tell you that this is not a typo.
