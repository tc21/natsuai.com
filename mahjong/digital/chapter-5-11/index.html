        <p>
             This is a <em>Kindai Mahjong Premier League game</em><span id="footnote-tag-1"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span>. I have a honitsu 1-shanten hand that could be as high as a baiman. I wanted to discard the completely useless <span class="tiles">y</span>, but pay attention to Suzuki Tatsuya (North)'s calls and discards. The hand looks like a manzu honitsu. <span class="tiles">o</span> was discarded on the 6th turn. He then called <span class="tiles">u</span>, discarding <span class="tiles">2</span>. If he was going for honitsu, why did he discard <span class="tiles">o</span> from a <span class="tiles">uuo</span> shape? It would be natural to keep the <span class="tiles">i</span> draw. So, discarding <span class="tiles">o</span> likely means that even after discarding <span class="tiles">o</span>, he can still make use of <span class="tiles">i</span>. This means he likely had <span class="tiles">yyuu</span>. Since we are reading that he has a <span class="tiles">y</span> pair, we cannot discard <span class="tiles">y</span>, even though <span class="tiles">e</span> and <span class="tiles">o</span> are safe. That said, neither can we discard <span class="tiles">5</span> or the dora <span class="tiles">j</span>. We pretty much have to bail, and can't do anything other than discard <span class="tiles">a</span> to tentatively stay in chiitoitsu 1-shanten. We will have to fully bail when we draw another dangerous tile.
        </p>
        <p> By the way, this was Suzuki Tatsuya's hand:</p>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="hand-container">
                <div class="hand compact">
                    <div class="hand-contents">
                        <span class="tiles">yynnn77<span class="separated sideways">U</span>uu<span class="separated sideways">$</span>44</span>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
             Although it was toitoi, instead of my read of honitsu, <span class="tiles">y</span> was as expected a deal-in tile. I successfully avoided a 5200-point deal-in. The fact that <span class="tiles">y</span> was the deal-in tile was just a coincidence. What's important is to use the information in discards to understand that <span class="tiles">y</span> is dangerous, and is a tile that cannot be played. Small theories like this one accumulate into real improvements in your results.
        </p>
        <p>
             However, as I said before, reads are not always right. If I drew <span class="tiles">j</span> or <span class="tiles">5</span> after discarding <span class="tiles">a</span>, I would have a very valuable hand. Considering the risk and reward, I would probably fight and play <span class="tiles">y</span>.
        </p>
