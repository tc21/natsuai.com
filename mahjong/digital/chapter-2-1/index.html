             In addition to winning your hand, you get 300 extra points. I'm not sure of the exact origins, but it comes from a time when there were less yaku, and when point calculations were different. After a dealer win or a ryuukyoku, everyone puts a 100-point stick on the table for the next winner to take. It was a time when the average win was smaller, and a mangan was 2000 points. Thus 300 points was significant, and at 2- or 3-honba, the honba sticks become very important. Since then the way we calculate points have changed. We've added rules like ippatsu, ura, and red fives, but the rule of adding just 300 points per honba has been kept till today.
        </p>
        <p> But what do honba sticks change about a game in reality?</p>
        <p>
             The size of a hand like pinfu-dora 1, shown above, changes little between 0-honba and 1-honba. At 4- or 5-honba the contribution of honba sticks become significant. At 5-honba, winning anything gives you 1500 bonus points, and dealing in means you lose 1500 points extra. In such a situation you can think less about yaku and more about winning before other people win. Of course, declaring riichi is also okay, but late in a hand or with a bad wait, more people would probably choose to damaten.
        </p>

        <p>
             I think having 300 points per honba is completely unnecessary. It only makes point calculations more complicated for no reason. I would call for removing honba. Basically, always at 0-honba no matter what happens. It allows simpler point calculations, so you can easier enjoy the game. <span id="footnote-tag-1">Mahjong Rengo<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span>, the organization I belong to, plays without honba.
        </p>
        <p>
             If you had to use honba sticks, considering the average size of hands nowadays, I would recommend each honba to be worth 1500 points. Honba worth this much would have an impact on the game, and 4- or 5-honba situations would become very interesting.
