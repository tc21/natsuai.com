    <div class="main-content">
        <p> Let's switch it up a bit and take a look at camouflaging for kokushi-musou.</p>
        <p>
             When you go for kokushi-musou, generally you discard the dangerous center tiles, and keep the safer terminals and honors. However, if all of the following conditions are met, you can consider intentionally discard from terminals and honors first.
        </p>
        <div class="inline">
            <ol>
                <li>Turn 1 or turn 2.</li>
                <li>You have two or more pairs.</li>
                <li>Around 1- to 3-shanten, relatively likely to win.</li>
                <li>Your useless tiles are 3 through 7 and would be conspicuous.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p> Basically, a hand like this.</p>
        <div class="hand-container">
            <div class="hand compact">
                <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">qyuzz.a1234456</span></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
             Discarding <span class="tiles">yu</span> from your first turn would be too obvious, so consider discarding <span class="tiles">z</span> first. Then, discarding <span class="tiles">yu</span> together is also quite conspicuous, so try to separate them with the next tile you draw. You want to create a natural-looking discard pile, such as <span class="tiles">zuky</span>. If you get to tenpai, the chance that someone deals in should be much higher.
        </p>
        <p>
             The highest level of kokushi-musou camouflaging would be the kokushi riichi. You reveal that you are tenpai for a yakuman without increasing the value of your hand. This is something that can only be done in special circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
             The first condition is that your discards look normal. If there is any reason for your opponents to suspect you have a kokushi or chiitoitsu, then the drawbacks of declaring riichi are too big.
        </p>
        <p>
             Then second condition is that your wait looks quite safe. In other words, it needs to be a 2- or 3-cut honor tile  of suji.
        </p>
        <p>
             When those two conditions are met, you can declare riichi, which limits the development of your opponents' hands, making it more likely that you find the winning tile that might be deep in the wall.
        </p>
        <p>
             However, the normal way to go for kokushi-musou is without any camouflaging. Keeping middle tiles in a hand that's far from winning is too big of a risk.
        </p>
        <div class="hand-container">
            <div class="hand compact">
                <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">qyuzb.f1234456</span></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
             With a hand like this, don't worry about camouflaging. Start discarding from <span class="tiles">f</span>, and keep the options open for a manzu or pinzu honitsu-chiitoi while you collect safe tiles.
        </p>
