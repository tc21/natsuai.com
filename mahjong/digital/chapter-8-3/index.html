             <strong>A</strong> is a hand where you've already called <span class="tiles">7</span> and the dora <span class="tiles">l</span>. When choosing between <span class="tiles">w</span> and <span class="tiles">n</span>, you kept the <span class="tiles">n</span> because of the better chance to create a ryanmen shape.
        </p>

             However, you drew <span class="tiles">e</span> resulting in <strong>B</strong>. You might say &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; and toss <span class="tiles">e</span> without thinking. However, if the dealer has called twice, including a dora pon, your opponents are probably starting to defend. It's unlikely that they'll let you call a <span class="tiles">b</span>. Is there anything you can do?
        </p>
        <p>
             You should discard <span class="tiles">n</span>. There isn't a big difference in tile efficiency, so you should take advantage of the <span class="tiles">w</span> being easier to call now that you've already discarded it. If you draw <span class="tiles">sg</span> first, you can just wait on a <span class="tiles">q</span> and <span class="tiles">v</span> shanpon, so there's no need to worry about furiten.
        </p>
        <p>
             Soon after, you draw <span class="tiles">b</span>. What now? <span class="tiles">w</span>, which you've already discarded, vs. <span class="tiles">n</span>, which you've already discarded. They're equally easy to call, so it's better to allow the possibility of getting <span class="tiles">c</span>, and discard <span class="tiles">e</span> this time. Again, if you draw <span class="tiles">sg</span> first, you can choose between a shanpon wait or a furiten ryanmen wait.

             By the way, I want to talk about how Takamizawa-pro played in the December 2013 Shou'ou Ketteisen<span id="footnote-tag-1"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span>. He was first in the total ranking, and was being heavily marked by the other players. His hand was <strong>C</strong>.

                        </div><div class="dora">
                            <div class="ruby ruby-center"><span class="tiles">x</span><div class="rt">Dora</div></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>

        <p>
             For some reason, his discards was <span class="tiles">qrx5</span>. And he discarded <span class="tiles">yu</span>! Since he couldn't hope to chii or ron <span class="tiles">ti</span>, he chose to keep the two shapes that are easy to call. I, his kamicha, broke up my hand to bail, discarding his genbutsu <span class="tiles">r</span>. He was waiting to chii, and then discarded the second <span class="tiles">5</span>! Surely he drew the <span class="tiles">5</span> after discarding <span class="tiles">yu</span>, but we were all very confused. With the other three players desperately bailing, Takamizawa was able to freely play his hand until ryuukyoku.
        </p>
        <p>
             Even though I'm able to recognize that he probably made the right play, I'm not sure I would be able to do the same thing myself. Although I had no idea what was going on when it happened, I'm impressed by what he did now that I've had a second look.
