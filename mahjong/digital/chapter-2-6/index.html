        <p>&ldquo;Let's just break ippatsu.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ippatsu is scary so I should try and stop it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
             I often hear something like this when people are faced with a riichi. How often does ippatsu-tsumo happen? There are 34 different tiles in mahjong. If every wait is a two-sided wait, then it would happen once every 17 times. Since waits can be worse, it actually happens about once every 20 times.
        </p>
        <p>
             When ippatsu-tsumo happens, how many points do you lose? If neither you nor the person who declares riichi are dealers, then even an ippatsu-tsumo that turns a mangan into a haneman would only lose you 1000 points. Some hands are smaller than a mangan. Other hands are the same size even with an added han. Therefore not breaking ippatsu would lose you around 500~800 points on average. You should think of it like this: &ldquo;If I don't break ippatsu, I have a 1 in 20 chance of losing around 800 points.&rdquo; That is not a number you need to be worried about. It might be excusable to do when you've decided to fully bail, but you should not break up a good, winnable hand just to break ippatsu.
        </p>
        <p>
             On the other hand, many people are afraid of dealing in to ippatsu. Precise numbers depend on the ruleset you use, but an average deal-in to riichi is about 6000 points, and an average deal-in to ippatsu is around 8000 points. So it's not nearly as important to avoid dealing into ippatsu then it is to avoid dealing in at all. If you wanted to play a tile that is unlikely to deal in to begin with, it would be unwise to not play it just because it's ippatsu.
        </p>
        <p>
             The truth is, even so, many people are afraid of ippatsu. Let's think about who stands to gain what and who stands to lose what when you forcibly break up your hand to break ippatsu.
        </p>
        <p>
             Of course the person declaring riichi loses out. But ippatsu doesn't happen often anyway, and their expected gain doesn't change that much. The person breaking ippatsu loses out. This loss cannot be disregarded. With two people at a disadvantage, the two remaining people on the table are the ones who benefit. Be immensely thankful if you're playing with someone who likes to break ippatsu. Make sure to always play a safe tile that's easily to call. They'll probably happily call it and break ippatsu for you.
        </p>
        <p>
             The situations to break ippatsu are, when you have decided to completely bail, or when you must lower that specific person's point gain no matter what. Please don't forcibly break ippatsu and end up spoiling your own hand.
        </p>
        <p>
             (Translator's note: another thing to consider is: how much more likely are you to deal in after breaking ippatsu? If you deal in, then that's a lot more than an 800-point average loss, and tiles that look dangerous now might end up safe later on, especially if the riichi happens fairly early.)
