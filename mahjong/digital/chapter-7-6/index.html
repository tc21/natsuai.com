             To play mahjong with placement points, you must be able to calculate your requirements for a comeback. Even if you know how far away you are from you opponents, not knowing what kind of hands you need to win would be tough. If you take too long calculating scores, you risk making misplays. You should aim to affirm your comeback requirements within one to two turns of play.
        </p>
        <p>
             The first you need to consider is how big of a hand would be enough for you to (1) win off of anyone. This is simple. Just take the actual point difference you need to make up, and any hand bigger than that is enough. How to comeback with a (2) tsumo is the confusing part. When you tsumo, you make up a difference of (your winning points + the amount of points your opponent pays). This is summarized in the chart shown below. If you memorize this chart, then you won't need to calculate anything, and would immediately know what kind of hand you need. Lastly you should at least keep in mind about what you need in a (3) direct hit. You shouldn't expect a direct hit, but know that it's half the difference between you and your opponent, or basically one han less than the &ldquo;(1) win off of anyone&rdquo; requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
             You might look at this chart and think it's a pain to memorize, but know that to good mahjong players, it's like their second nature. For example, they've memorized lines such as &ldquo;thirteen, twenty-six is sixty-five, seventy-eight&rdquo;. Once you've got the hang of calculating points and building hands, try to get good at using this point-difference chart.
