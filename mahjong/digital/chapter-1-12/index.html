             How should you play when it looks like you're unlikely to win? The important thing is to not bail your hand, while also not increasing your chances of dealing in. In other words, holding on to safe tiles without bailing.

             <strong>A</strong> is a fairly common shape. 1-shanten with two ryanmen shapes. If, for example, you drew <span class="tiles">v</span> here and discarded <span class="tiles">4</span>, you would have a higher win rate, but also a higher deal-in rate. To avoid this, you can choose to keep the shape in <strong>A</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
             Let's apply this to more hands. In other words, not just during 1-shanten, but to be aware to keep the same number of honor tiles as your shanten. <strong>B</strong> is 2-shanten, so two honor tiles; <strong>C</strong> is 3-shanten, thus 3. Building your hand this way ensures that you are able to defend yourself against others when your hand isn't progressing. Although you will lose safe tiles when your hand progresses, but the better hand should enable you to take those risks. From a tile efficiency perspective, <strong>D</strong> is closer to winning than <strong>C</strong>, but <strong>C</strong> is a lot safer than <strong>D</strong>. At the cost of some tile efficiency, swapping <span class="tiles">dkl</span> with <span class="tiles">234</span> gives you a good hand with the flexibility to attack or to defend.

             The concept of keeping the same amount of safe tiles as your shanten is not limited to closed hands. <strong>E</strong> is the same. Even if you wanted to attack while staying safe, not calling <span class="tiles">5</span> here is too cowardly. Calling the <span class="tiles">5</span> not only completes a set but guarantees a yaku. It increases your win rate by an order of magnitude, so you should probably call it. That said, discarding an honor tile here will make your hand too dangerous. It would be better to discard <span class="tiles">v</span>. The resulting shape is <strong>F</strong>. 2-shanten, and you have 2 safe tiles. If you later draw <span class="tiles">.</span> or <span class="tiles">s</span>, you can just discard it. Much like hand <strong>B</strong>, progress towards winning without forcing the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
             Of course, this is just for when you want to progress your hand while staying safe. If <span class="tiles">a</span> or <span class="tiles">5</span> was dora, then you wouldn't need to be this careful. Such a hand would be worth the risk, and you should discard your honor tiles and go full-on attack.
