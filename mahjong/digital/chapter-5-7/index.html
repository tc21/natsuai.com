             Let's look at the discard pile <strong>A</strong>. After discarding <span class="tiles">v4</span>, a <span class="tiles">z</span> riichi. Something feels unnatural about this. They don't look like they're going for chanta or sanshoku, so what makes <span class="tiles">z</span> a more useful tile than <span class="tiles">v</span>?
        </p>
        <p>
             The answer is chiitoitsu. They are waiting on something better than the suji <span class="tiles">z</span>. In other words, honor tiles, or safe 1/9 tiles that everyone is likely to discard. However, rare cases like discarding <span class="tiles">z</span> from a shape like <span class="tiles">zzzer</span> also exist, so don't be so sure that they have chiitoitsu.
        </p>
        <p>
             What about <strong>B</strong>? They broke up a pair, but kept the second tile until they got into tenpai. Their first discard was <span class="tiles">z</span>, so they likely don't have tiles related to <span class="tiles">z</span>. What's likely is <span class="tiles">bm.</span> or <span class="tiles">bmm</span>, making <span class="tiles">,</span> and <span class="tiles">m</span> dangerous. In particular, if you look at their discards they have a lot of smaller numbered tiles, making 789 sanshoku a likely possibility. Even though <span class="tiles">,</span> is suji, don't discard it so easily.
        </p>
        <p>
             What about <strong>C</strong>? They discarded <span class="tiles">v</span> very early, but their riichi declaration tile is <span class="tiles">b</span>. Rather than having <span class="tiles">vvbb</span>, there's a possibility that they didn't have <span class="tiles">b</span> when they discarded <span class="tiles">v</span>, but drew it later and was able to keep it. In other words there's a chance they have <span class="tiles">bm.</span>, and are waiting on <span class="tiles">,</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
             Up until now, I've been talking about reading your opponent's wait using two tiles from the same suit. Once upon a time this kind of theory was not popular. In the past, camouflaging, or techniques to conceal your wait, was highly valued. For example, in example <strong>5.6 A</strong> from the previous section, someone might discard <span class="tiles">v</span> first, and then <span class="tiles">x</span>, to conceal the fact that they are waiting on <span class="tiles">cn</span>. Also, more people waited for an improvement before declaring riichi back then, meaning example <strong>B</strong> (from this section) could well be improving a kanchan <span class="tiles">n</span> wait to a <span class="tiles">n.</span> ryanmen wait.
        </p>
        <p>
             Today, people better understand how to make a hand, and better appreciate the value of a first riichi. So you could say these theories here are made possible my modern mahjong theory. That said, knowing the theories of modern mahjong, and still discarding in the order of <span class="tiles">vx</span> from <span class="tiles">xvvb</span> could potentially be an effective way to trick your opponents. It might be an interesting thing to try every once in a while. Additionally, some players still play like that all the time, so be careful not to be too confident in your hand reading.
