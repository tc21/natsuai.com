             Having three sets and a pair, and two spare tiles is called a <span id="footnote-tag-1">&ldquo;kuttsuki&rdquo;<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span> shape. From such a shape, you enter tenpai by drawing a tile next to one of those spare tiles, or by drawing your pair into a triplet. Generally, you'll be choosing between two or three tiles to drop every turn, and you want to make sure to play the most efficient tile in terms of tile efficiency and final tenpai shape.

        <p>
             Let's look at this table. We can't touch the manzu shape, which contains a dora, so we're choosing between <span class="tiles">n</span> and <span class="tiles">h</span> to discard. One turn ago, we chose <span class="tiles">h</span> to discard when there wasn't much difference between the two. This turn, we've drawn <span class="tiles">h</span> again. Some people would instinctively discard <span class="tiles">h</span>, but is that really the right choice?
        </p>
        <p>
             If you look closely at the table, you'll notice that the turn that just passed has created a big difference between the two tiles.
        </p>
        <p>
             Let's look at pinzu. We now see three <span class="tiles">m</span> discarded, which greatly reduces the value of <span class="tiles">n</span>. <span class="tiles">,</span> is basically useless. <span class="tiles">b</span> isn't that great of a draw either. <span class="tiles">m</span> is still a good draw, but it's unlikely to happen with only one left. What about souzu? Plenty of <span class="tiles">g</span> and <span class="tiles">j</span> remain, and with three <span class="tiles">h</span> visible from our point-of-view, <span class="tiles">j</span> and <span class="tiles">k</span> become difficult for our opponents to use. This means that in addition to ryanmen waits, a kanchan wait after drawing <span class="tiles">k</span> is also worth waiting for.
        </p>
        <p>
             Therefore, you should keep <span class="tiles">h</span> and discard <span class="tiles">n</span> here. The only drawback of keeping <span class="tiles">h</span> is if you draw another <span class="tiles">h</span>, you become furiten. But that is quite unlikely to happen, since there's only one <span class="tiles">h</span>, compared to <span class="tiles">gjk</span>, so it's not something to worry about.
        </p>
        <p>
             On the other hand, drawing <span class="tiles">f</span> is a bit less straightforward. If it looks like you'll still have time to build your hand, then don't take the tenpai and wait for a better draw with the manzu shape. Otherwise, riichi on the kanchan <span class="tiles">g</span> wait.
        </p>
