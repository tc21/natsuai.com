             East round, and points are fairly level (we started with 30000 points in this game). The turn before, I discarded <span class="tiles">.</span>, not to be focused on honiitsu. That said, the hand naturally become honiitsu if I draw a middle pinzu tile. I then called the <span class="tiles">6</span> that was discarded immediately after. What should I discard here? Looking for honiitsu or honroutou, <span class="tiles">3</span> and <span class="tiles">x</span> should be kept. So I'm choosing between <span class="tiles">t</span> and <span class="tiles">d</span>. Considering that two <span class="tiles">s</span> have already been discarded, some people would discard <span class="tiles">d</span>, but is that really the best choice?
        </p>
        <p>
             Discarding <span class="tiles">s</span> this early on is a sign that someone doesn't have <span class="tiles">a</span> to <span class="tiles">d</span>, and also can't use <span class="tiles">a</span> and <span class="tiles">s</span>. With two people discarding <span class="tiles">s</span>, waiting on tiles next to <span class="tiles">d</span> would be really good. What about tiles next to <span class="tiles">t</span>? Although they have not been discarded, we cannot guarantee they still remain in the wall. Considering that <span class="tiles">e</span> is the dora, we cannot necessarily hope that someone will deal into us.
        </p>
        <p>
             In this game, I chose to discard <span class="tiles">t</span>. Even if I can't use the dora anymore, I can get chanta by drawing souzu. Even without that, this hand is valuable enough with the riichi sticks + 3 honba.
        </p>
        <p>
             Later, I was able to pon <span class="tiles">2</span> and draw <span class="tiles">a</span>, waiting on <span class="tiles">s</span> just as I had hoped.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="hand-container">
                <div class="hand compact">
                    <div class="hand-contents">
                        <span class="tiles">zzzad44<span class="separated sideways">"</span>22<span class="separated">6</span><span class="sideways">&</span>6</span>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
             As expected there were two <span class="tiles">s</span> remaining in the wall. I was able to pon <span class="tiles">4</span> and change my hand into honroutou.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="hand-container">
                <div class="hand compact">
                    <div class="hand-contents">
                        <span class="tiles">zzza<span class="separated sideways">$</span>44<span class="separated sideways">"</span>22<span class="separated">6</span><span class="sideways">&</span>6</span>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
             And there were three <span class="tiles">a</span> in the wall! The player in north seat declared riichi, but I was able to win a tsumo haneman without dealing in. You can say that this is because I wasn't blinded by counting the tiles I can see, but rather was able to read which suits and tiles were available in the wall.
