             If you have previously discarded a tile that would your hand, you cannot call ron. It was with the invention of this rule in the late 1940s that (riichi) mahjong gained the complexity of attacking vs. defending, and started to become the interesting game we know today.

        <p>
             However, many people have suffered under the furiten<span id="footnote-tag-1"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span> rule. My most recent chonbo was a furiten ron<span id="footnote-tag-2"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-2" title="jump to footnote 2">[2]</a></span>. I was defending against a riichi, and made an unexpected tenpai, and immediately someone dealt in. I said &ldquo;ron!&rdquo; but it turns out that's a tile I've discarded already...

             Look at this hand please. You've already discarded <span class="tiles">z</span>. What should you discard now? Should you discard <span class="tiles">xc</span> to avoid furiten, or should you discard <span class="tiles">qw</span> to keep ryanmen?
        </p>
        <p>
             First let's consider the situation where you draw <span class="tiles">hl</span> first. If you kept <span class="tiles">qw</span>, you can declare a penchan-wait riichi. But I don't think it's a much more attractive option than a furiten <span class="tiles">zv</span> riichi. Additionally, if you don't declare riichi, <span class="tiles">zv</span> is better than <span class="tiles">e</span> since you won't be able to win unless you tsumo anyway. In other words, if you draw <span class="tiles">hl</span> first, there's not too much difference between keeping <span class="tiles">xc</span> and <span class="tiles">qw</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
             On the other hand, let's think about making this hand into a good hand that waits on <span class="tiles">hl</span>. If you keep <span class="tiles">qw</span>, unless you draw one of the four remaining <span class="tiles">e</span>, you won't be waiting on <span class="tiles">hl</span>. Keeping <span class="tiles">xc</span> allows you to draw any of seven remaining <span class="tiles">zv</span>. Thus it's better to keep the <span class="tiles">xc</span>, which is easy to take care of.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Drawing <span class="tiles">hl</span> and staying datamen &rarr; <span class="tiles">zv</span> ryanmen is better.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Getting to <span class="tiles">hl</span> tenpai first &rarr; keeping <span class="tiles">zv</span> ryanmen is better.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                <div class="caption-text">Comparing the two options</div>

        </div>
        <p>
             Thus when given the hand at the beginning, you should discard <span class="tiles">qw</span>. Whether you consider the likelihood of getting rid of the bad shape by drawing into it, or the strength of your tenpai wait on average, it's better to keep the ryanmen shape. To be more specific, you should discard <span class="tiles">q</span>. If you draw <span class="tiles">e</span> the next turn, you should look at the table to compare <span class="tiles">qr</span> against <span class="tiles">zv</span>, and keep the better ryanmen.

                 Kobayashi explains here, that &ldquo;furu&rdquo; means &ldquo;throw away&rdquo;, and &ldquo;furiten&rdquo; means &ldquo;tenpai when you've thrown away your winning tile&rdquo;, and that the concept of furiten doesn't exist unless you are tenpai, so you shouldn't call something furiten unless they're already tenpai.
