             Tedashi vs. tsumogiri is an important hint towards correctly reading your opponents' hands. If you memorize the tedashi and tsumogiri status of every tile from every opponent, and react accordingly, certainly your results will be better. But, to be honest, memorizing every tile is just too much work.
        </p>
        <p>
             For those of you who think that way, start by trying to just remember the tsumogiri and tedashi of opponents you decide to pay attention to. The opponents you should be paying attention to include those in direct competition with you for placement, those that have called twice, and those that have called with a possibly large hand. It's a good idea to start by practicing memorizing discards by following this rule.
        </p>
        <p>
             Now let's change our perspective, and think about tedashi vs. tsumogiri when we are the person being paid attention to. Look at this situation.

             After calling the double-<span class="tiles">1</span>, we are 1-shanten with dora 2. We can also call into tenpai. We draw <span class="tiles">f</span>. We should be discarding <span class="tiles">v</span> or <span class="tiles">f</span>. It looks like neither souzu nor pinzu are better than the other, so there's not much difference in how likely we are to draw <span class="tiles">cn</span> compared to <span class="tiles">dh</span>. We only need to think about how much information our discards give away.
        </p>
        <p>
             First, let's think about discarding <span class="tiles">v</span>. The pinzu tedashi will make your opponents cautious of its surrounding tiles, and discarding <span class="tiles">f</span> when your hand progresses will make them cautious of souzu as well. Tedashi of <span class="tiles">f</span> <span class="tiles">v</span> will cause the same effect, making their surrounding tiles difficult to come out, and unlikely for you to chii or ron.
        </p>
        <p>
             With the above considerations, the best thing to do here is <span class="tiles">f</span> tsumogiri. Either way people will be cautious about tiles next to your tenpai discard <span class="tiles">v</span>, but you don't give away any information regarding souzu, so <span class="tiles">dh</span> are much easier to come out compared to the other options of playing your hand.
        </p>
        <p>
             Even when discarding the same tile, tedashi vs. tsumogiri affects how much information you give away about your hand. You cannot prevent your opponents being on guard against your tenpai discard. Even so, try to give away as little information about your hand as possible, so you gain an advantage if you draw into a <span class="tiles">dh</span> tenpai. Ideally, you should tsumogiri without any noticeable pause.
        </p>
