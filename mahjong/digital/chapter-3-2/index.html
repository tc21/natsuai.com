             Getting to tenpai faster is the biggest merit of calling. The drawbacks are having smaller hands, and having less tiles to defend with.
        </p>
        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">eryiixvnmghh4</span></div><div class="dora">
                            <div class="ruby ruby-center"><span class="tiles">3</span><div class="rt">Dora</div></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             Hand <strong>A</strong> is a hand that almost guaranteed to be tanyao. The tile you want the most is <span class="tiles">c</span>. You want to call it if you can.
        </p>
        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents">
                            <span class="tiles">eryiinmghh<span class="separated sideways">C</span>xv</span>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             Look at <strong>B</strong>, the hand after calling <span class="tiles">c</span>. The kanchan shape is taken care of, leaving mainly good shapes in the hand. The hand feels much closer to winning. Although the hand is less safe, your increased win probability also means your opponents are less likely to win, counteracting the increased danger by calling.
        </p>
        <p> What if you called <span class="tiles">er</span> first?</p>
        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents">
                            <span class="tiles">yiixvnmghh<span class="separated sideways">W</span>er</span>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             You did finish a set, but <span class="tiles">xv</span> is still a weak point in your hand. The hand does not feel much closer to winning. You also have to worry about the decreased ability to defend due to having less tiles. Now what if we called again?
        </p>
        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents">
                            <span class="tiles">yiixvghh<span class="separated sideways"><</span>nm<span class="sideways">W</span>er</span>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             This is a hand that makes me feel anxious. Someone else declaring riichi when you have this hand would be a disaster. The hand is full of dangerous tiles, and you have to deal with bad shapes. Even if you get to tenpai, it's likely to be the kanchan <span class="tiles">c</span> wait, which cannot be called good.
        </p>
        <p>
             Therefore, the only tile you should call from hand <strong>A</strong> is <span class="tiles">c</span>. You should be able to take care of the good shapes in <span class="tiles">eryiinmghh</span> by tsumo, so calling them do not give you an advantage. Remember, when you have a hand that's still far away from tenpai, to start calling from the bad shapes.
        </p>
