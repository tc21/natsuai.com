             This is your starting hand. To be honest it's pretty bad. How do you envision this hand to proceed, and what should you discard?
        </p>
        <p>
             One opinion I've often heard is &ldquo;Clearly this hand is slower than everyone else's. Instead of trying to make it work, let's discard <span class="tiles">v</span> and go for chanta or chiitoitsu, and feel really lucky if I win.&rdquo; I think this is too pessimistic. With this many terminal and honors in your hand, you don't need to specifically discard middle tiles to keep your hand relatively safe. It's probably unlikely that you will end up without safe tiles when someone else attacks. In just two or three turns, your hand could look like this:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">qeuiivbm.j337</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">qeiim.hj33677</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
             That's not good enough to call advantageous, but certainly good enough to fight. So there's no need to be that pessimistic from the first turn. There are almost no cases where you would avoid dealing in because you discarded <span class="tiles">v</span> or <span class="tiles">j</span> here. You are more likely to miss out on a win because you threw away some of the few paths to a winning hand. Be direct and discard the tiles you don't want. That said, &ldquo;the most useless tile <span class="tiles">4</span>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<span class="tiles">7</span>, before someone else pairs it up&rdquo; is probably too aggressive. Your safest bet is to recognize that your hand is disadvantageous, keep your honor tiles, and discard <span class="tiles">a</span>, the tile that has the fewest losses. Even then your hand could still naturally progress into chiitoitsu or chanta.
        </p>

             When discussing mahjong, the topic of what to discard from unattractive hands like this one is unlikely to come up. But in practice, these kinds of ordinary hands appear the most. While each individual play has a very small effect on your results, the ways you treat ordinary hands like this one can add up and become a big difference.
        </p>
        <p>
             I've often heard this take. &ldquo;In each game of mahjong only 1 out of 4 people can win. When you have a bad hand, there's no need to try to win every hand. The way you treat the 75% of hands you can't win is important.&rdquo; But if you only play the starting hands that look like the best of the 4 players, your win rate will be a lot lower than 1 in 4. Even with a bad hand, don't give up. Do your best. What's important is to try to win some more hands, and limit the amount of points you lose.
        </p>

             In the next section I'll talk about some techniques for when you have ordinary hands like this one.
