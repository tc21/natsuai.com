             &ldquo;Camouflage&rdquo; is a term that's not used as much as it used to be. On a battlefield, camouflage conceals your own movements, making it difficult for your enemies to notice. In the 1980s, camouflages, or techniques to prevent opponents from reading your hands, were highly rated, and often used.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="hand-container">
                <div class="hand compact">
                    <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">qeruuoxccmsl34</span></div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
             Look at this hand. The tactics of camouflaging is to discard <span class="tiles">cru</span> from this hand, and go for chanta or a 123 sanshoku. But nowadays we prioritize speed, and this playstyle became detrimental. To begin with, making a 123 sanshoku from this hand is extremely difficult, not to mention that if you end up waiting on souzu, your hard-worked camouflage would be for naught. Rather than slowing down your hand, it's better to make use of the <span class="tiles">er</span> ryanmen, and treat <span class="tiles">xcc</span> as two potential sets, and discard <span class="tiles">34</span> or <span class="tiles">l</span>. Such is the mainstream.
        </p>
        <p>
             That said, it would be premature to say that camouflage is dead, and a thing of the past. In my opinion, there are many useful camouflaging techniques that still work today, in the age of racing to be the first tenpai and first riichi.
        </p>

        <p>
             In relation to camouflaging, there is a discard technique called <span id="footnote-tag-1">&ldquo;sakigiri&rdquo;<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a></span>. This mainly refers to confirming a ryanmen shape before you get to tenpai, for example, discarding <span class="tiles">c</span> from <span class="tiles">xcc</span>. That alone isn't enough conceal your wait for sure, but when the sakigiri happens very early on, it can be very effective<span id="footnote-tag-2"><a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-2" title="jump to footnote 2">[2]</a></span>.
        </p>
        <p> For example, if this was your discard pile (every tile is tedashi):</p>
        <div class="hand-container">
            <div class="hand compact discards">
                <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">3cl7ift</span></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
             People will be cautious of the tiles around <span class="tiles">f</span> and <span class="tiles">t</span>, tiles you needed until you were tenpai (or very close), but people are unlikely to think you are waiting on <span class="tiles">zv</span> or <span class="tiles">xb</span>, when you discarded <span class="tiles">c</span> that early. This kind of sakigiri is also a type of camouflage, and it's quite effective even today. However, if you overuse it, you'll end up losing tile efficiency by discarding a <span class="tiles">c</span> that you would have been able to use. You have to at least prioritize getting to four sets and a pair.
