             Hand <strong>A</strong> is a 4th turn hand by a non-dealer player. Should we aim for pinfu and discard <span class="tiles">7</span>? Should we try to use <span class="tiles">7</span> while accepting a <span id="footnote-tag-1">
                ryanmen<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-content-1" title="jump to footnote 1">[1]</a>
            </span> riichi and discard <span class="tiles">l</span>? Or should we aim to utilize <span class="tiles">7</span> no matter what and discard a ryanmen shape? Think about it for a moment.
        </p>
        <p>
             First let's consider discarding <span class="tiles">7</span>. If the hand advances normally and becomes pinfu-dora 1, you will probably declare riichi, and have a hand that's 3900 points on ron, 5200 points on tsumo. If you discard <span class="tiles">l</span>, most likely you will have riichi-dora 1. That's 2600 points on ron, 4000 on tsumo. Comparing these numbers, discarding <span class="tiles">7</span> would be better. But if you look closely, although your hand increases by 1 han, the value of the hand didn't increase by a lot. Usually increasing a hand by 1 han should double its value, but pinfu lowers the fu of your hand and makes the increase not as significant. If you were going to declare riichi anyway, there is no reason to be fixated on something like pinfu. By the way, if you end up gaining an uradora, the difference pinfu brings becomes even smaller.
        </p>
        <p>
             The question is, how your hand can change if you do not immediately draw into tenpai. First, compare (between the two choices of discard) the difference when you draw your pair into a triplet.
        </p>
        <ol class="example-list" style="counter-reset: list-counter 1;">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">qweyuxcfghlll</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">qweyuxcfgh777</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             Since both shapes allow you to become tenpai by drawing one of your ryanmen shapes into a pair (that is, drawing <span class="tiles">yuxc</span>), having the <span class="tiles">7</span> triplet is obviously better.
        </p>
        <p> Now lets compare drawing a pair in your ryanmen-shape first.</p>
        <ol class="example-list" style="counter-reset: list-counter 3;">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">qweyuuxcfghll</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">qweyuuxcfgh77</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             Comparing the two, <strong>E</strong> is better as it allows you to call <span class="tiles">7</span> at anytime to get into tenpai.
        </p>
        <p>
             Finally let's look at discarding a ryanmen shape from the initial hand. Fixating on the one han from <span class="tiles">7</span> to the point of hurting your chances of a ryanmen riichi is not something that can be recommended. It's best to treat <span class="tiles">7</span> as your pair until you draw into a shape like <strong>C</strong> or <strong>E</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
             To summarize, the solution to hand <strong>A</strong> is to consider both the ryanmen riichi and the potential ways to utilize <span class="tiles">7</span>, and discard the pair of <span class="tiles">l</span>.
        </p>

             Literally, &ldquo;two sided&rdquo;. Two adjacent tiles, completable on both sides. e.g. <span class="tiles">er</span>.
        </li>
    </ol>
