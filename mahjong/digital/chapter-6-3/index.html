             Of all yaku, the easiest to read are flush hands. Honitsu especially appears very often, signaled by a two-suit discard pile, and aggressive calling. Most of the time, people will be able to read that you have honitsu.
        </p>
        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact discards">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">ko4dj2rt</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             For example, if someone with discard pile <strong>A</strong> starts calling pinzu or honor tiles, then you can assume they have honitsu. However, it's possible to conceal a honitsu if you make a discard pile that's less obvious as this one. To do so, you will need to keep tiles from another suit. Of course, there's a significant risk of discarding a tile that you could have used instead, or ending up with furiten, so it's important to look for methods to do this without losing much tile efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
             For example, you called pon on <span class="tiles">5</span>, and need to discard from hand <strong>B</strong>. Your discard pile is <strong>C</strong>.
        </p>
        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents">
                            <span class="tiles">zzbn,..sf33<span class="separated">5</span><span class="sideways">%</span>5</span>
                        </div><div class="dora">
                            <div class="ruby ruby-center"><span class="tiles">q</span><div class="rt">Dora</div></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact discards">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">oy2ke7</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             You want to get rid of the <span class="tiles">sf</span> kanchan, but discarding <span class="tiles">fs</span> in succession draws a lot of attention. To avoid drawing too much attention, you discard <span class="tiles">s</span>. Then, you pon <span class="tiles">z</span>. What should you discard from <strong>D</strong>?
        </p>
        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact">
                        <div class="hand-contents">
                            <span class="tiles">bn,..f33<span class="separated">z</span>z<span class="sideways">Z</span><span class="separated">5</span><span class="sideways">%</span>5</span>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             Obviously, you don't need <span class="tiles">f</span>, but discarding <span class="tiles">f</span> right after <span class="tiles">s</span> makes it obvious that you're making a honitsu. I recommend discarding <span class="tiles">,</span>. You can put a pinzu in your discard pile without losing the ability to use <span class="tiles">m</span>. After that, try to keep <span class="tiles">f</span> for as long as you can, and discard it the next time you chii or pon.
        </p>
        <p>
             This way, your discard pile becomes <strong>E</strong>. If you discarded <span class="tiles">f</span> first, your discard pile would be <strong>F</strong>.
        </p>
        <ol class="example-list">
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact discards">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">oy2ke7s,4wf</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="hand-container">
                    <div class="hand compact discards">
                        <div class="hand-contents"><span class="tiles">oy2ke7fs4w,</span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
             Compare the two discard piles. <strong>F</strong> is obvious honitsu, but <strong>E</strong> could possibly be toitoi, or something related to <span class="tiles">f</span>, such as a <span class="tiles">dh</span> wait. Pinzu tiles become less suspicious. Although by playing like this, you will miss out on a ryanmen wait if you draw <span class="tiles">m</span>, you gain more by making all pinzu easier to come out.
        </p>
        <p>
             Just like this, you can try to camouflage what would have been an obvious honitsu by utilizing a tile from another suit.
